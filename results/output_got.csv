0,fullfact,"Men may be taken to court and face serious sentences if they whistle at a woman and she calls the police, if proposals to count misogyny as a hate crime go ahead.
","“But the proposals [from campaigners] are so far ranging that lads could be dragged before courts and face serious sentences if they whistle at a woman and she calls police.” Daily Star, 10 July 2018  Proposals to add misogyny as a category of hate crime will not make anything illegal if it’s not already. Instead, crimes where the motivation is perceived to be the fact that the victim is a woman could result in harsher sentences. There have been several reports in the media that wolf whistling is to be categorised as a hate crime in the UK. This is because gender equality campaigners and religious leaders signed an open letter asking the National Police Chiefs’ Council to vote to “record misogyny as a hate crime”. Misogyny is a hatred of or prejudice against women. Nottinghamshire police started categorising cases where someone is targeted because they are a woman as a hate crime back in 2016. North Yorkshire Police followed in 2017. Wolf whistling will not be illegal under these proposals. Nothing currently legal would become illegal. The police in England, Wales and Northern Ireland classify a hate crime as a “criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice” based on someone’s actual or perceived race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or them being transgender. These are the minimum five types of hate crime the police have to record. According to the College of Policing, police forces are “free to extend their own [hate crime] policy response to include the hostilities that they believe are prevalent in their area or that are causing the greatest concern to the community”. Nottinghamshire police added misogyny to the characteristics that might motivate a hate crime, and that’s what campaigners are now asking the police to roll out nationally. This would also affect the categorisation of hate incidents, which are “non-crime incidents” motivated by “hostility or prejudice” from those listed above, where nothing illegal is deemed to have happened. Because of this, it seems unlikely that wolf whistling would lead to a prosecution, unless it was part of a wider case of illegal abusive behaviour. Wolf whistling could potentially be recorded as a hate incident, as the act itself is not illegal. You can read more about how hate crimes differ from hate incidents in our factcheck. Categorising something as a hate crime means that if the person is convicted, the Crown Prosecution Service can apply for what’s called an uplift, which can lead to a harsher sentence. More than half of successful hate crime prosecutions in 2016/17 had successfully uplifted sentences. Any crime “perceived, by the victim or any other person” to be motivated by certain hostilities or prejudices can be classed as a hate crime and potentially qualify for an uplift. Examples given by the police include robbery, harassment, criminal damage, and assault. Between April 2016 (when Nottinghamshire Police added misogyny to their definition) and March 2018, they recorded a total of 174 misogynistic hate crimes and incidents. In that time there had been one conviction. The vast majority of hate crime in England and Wales is racially motivated. Out of the 80,400 offences recorded in 2016/17 where one of the hate crime characteristics were a “motivating factor”, just under 80% were race hate crimes, although crimes can have more than one motivating factor. Over half of hate crime offences in 2016/17 took the form of public order offences, such as harassment or using threatening words and behaviour. A third involved violence against a person. Around 10% were criminal damage or other notifiable offences, like sexual offences or theft. Update 13 July 2018  We've clarified where we're talking about the UK as a whole and about England and Wales specifically. Correction 29 January 2019  We corrected a typo in the graph so it now reads ""Violence against the person"".","Even if rules do change on categorising hate crimes, wolf whistling in isolation would likely be classified as a hate incident, rather than crime, as it is not illegal. So wolf whistling alone is unlikely to result in prosecution.

1,fullfact,"The justice budget has fallen by 40% since 2010.
"," “We’ve seen 40% cuts to the prison and criminal justice system.” Rachel Shabi, 6 February 2020 The journalist Rachel Shabi claimed during a Question Time debate on the release of terrorism offenders that the justice budget had fallen by 40%. When we contacted her, she said this referred to the government’s widely reported plans in the 2015 spending review, which would have given the Ministry of Justice a budget in 2019-20 that was 40% smaller, in real terms, than in 2010-11. The figure was still being used by the Guardian and the Law Gazette this month. However that 40% fall never happened. The Treasury gave the department £1.18bn more than planned for 2018/19, then £1.33bn more for 2019/20. In particular, the money was intended to meet a shortfall in probate income (generated from estates of the deceased), and to fund demand for legal aid that remained higher than the government anticipated.    The House of Commons Library also said: “There have also been significant operational challenges within the prison service, and additional funding has also been provided for court reform.” This means that the revised budget of the Ministry of Justice in 2019-20 is in fact about 25% lower in real terms (i.e. after adjusting for inflation) than it was in 2010-11. The government also plans to spend more on justice in the 2020-21 budget than in 2019-20.","This was a proposal, but is now out of date. The government announced a 40% real terms reduction in the Ministry of Justice budget between 2010/11 and 2019/20, but in the end the reduction was 25%.

18,fullfact,"Lord Kerr, who sits on the UK Supreme Court, wrote Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.
","Following the unanimous decision of the UK Supreme Court that the government’s prorogation of parliament was unlawful, there has been some discussion of the judges who heard the case. The Conservative politician and former MEP David Campbell Bannerman seemed to claim on Twitter that Lord Kerr, one of the eleven justices who heard the prorogation case, was the author of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Article 50 is the section of the Treaty on European Union that sets out the legal mechanism for a member state leaving the EU.  I am afraid I am not at all surprised at the Supreme Court decision. They are the Establishment writ large and are 100% Remain. Lord Kerr wrote Article 50 of Lisbon?! After we achieve Brexit, we must do some urgent reworking of our Constitution to put the people back in charge. This is wrong. The Lord Kerr who sits on the Supreme Court is a different Lord Kerr to the Lord Kerr who was an author of Article 50. The Supreme Court’s Lord Kerr is Brian Kerr, Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore, a former Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. The Lord Kerr who was involved with Article 50 is John Kerr, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, a career diplomat and former UK Permanent Representative to the EU. Between 2002 and 2003, before his peerage, he served as Secretary-General of the “Convention on the Future of Europe”, the body which drafted the text that ultimately formed the basis for the Lisbon Treaty, including Article 50. Information wrongly describing John Kerr as one of the Supreme Court justices was also added to Wikipedia, where it was live for just over an hour.","Wrong. There are two Lord Kerrs.

27,fullfact,"Upskirting is not illegal because there is no specific crime covering the act.
","“A Liberal Democrat MP has tabled a parliamentary bill that would make it a criminal offence to take a photo up a person’s skirt without their permission. Wera Hobhouse introduced the bill after discovering “upskirting” is not illegal because there is no specific crime covering the act.” Independent, 8 March 2018 Last week parliament was presented with a bill which if passed would make “upskirting” (or taking a photo or video up someone’s skirt) an offence in England and Wales. Upskirting is already an offence in certain situations. Offenders have been prosecuted for upskirting offences under the existing voyeurism clauses in the Sexual Offences Act, and the common law offence of outraging public decency. But there are criticisms that these laws don’t go  far enough.    For example, the offence of outraging public decency has to be witnessed by two or more other people. And to be an offence under the voyeurism clauses, the upskirting would have to record a “private act”.  The upskirting bill would add to the existing Sexual Offences Act, specifying that recording an image or ‘operating equipment’ beneath the clothing of another person without their consent, for the purposes of sexual gratification or to humiliate or distress the person, is an offence. The bill applies to the law in England and Wales as justice matters are devolved in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Northern Ireland’s voyeurism laws under the Sexual Offences Order 2008 are currently the same as in England and Wales.

3,fullfact,"Human rights aren’t devolved in Northern Ireland.
","“I fundamentally disagree with the idea of a British Prime Minister imposing whatever her view is on the people of Northern Ireland when it comes to a devolved issue.” Kate Forbes MSP, 31 May 2018 “It's not devolved human rights, though. Human rights aren’t devolved.” Caroline Flint MP, 31 May 2018 Human rights aren’t one thing, they are set out and protected by different parts of the law and government. In general, human rights are a devolved matter for Northern Ireland, like anything that isn’t explicitly kept to Westminster. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 established a Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to “keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness in Northern Ireland of law and practice relating to the protection of human rights.” However, the Assembly and Northern Ireland Ministers must comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. They can choose to establish human rights requirements that go beyond the Convention, but they cannot choose to have less human rights. That rule comes from the peace agreement made to end the Troubles in Northern Ireland, known as the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement, which called for safeguards including: “the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and any Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland supplementing it, which neither the Assembly nor public bodies can infringe, together with a Human Rights Commission.” The law on abortion is also a devolved matter. It’s currently covered by the criminal law in Northern Ireland. How human rights relate to abortion legally is complicated. Many different abortion laws are possible within the European Convention on Human Rights, as the different laws in Northern Ireland, England and Wales and Scotland, and in Ireland show. Next week the UK Supreme Court will issue judgement on a case brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. It will decide whether abortion law in Northern Ireland is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights “in failing to provide an exception to the prohibition on the termination of pregnancy in Northern Ireland in cases of serious malformation of the unborn child/foetus or pregnancy as a result of rape or incest”. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","In general human rights are a devolved matter in Northern Ireland, but the Assembly and Northern Ireland Ministers are required to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights.

4,fullfact,"At 16 we’re free from parental control, we can leave home, we can start a family, we can get married, we can start work, we can pay taxes, we can join the forces.
","“At 16 we’re free from parental control, we can leave home, we can start a family, we can get married, we can start work, we can pay taxes, we can join the forces.” Emily Thornberry, 31 January 2018 Legally you are considered to be a child if you’re under the age of 18. Until you reach this age you can’t buy alcohol or do things like leave education or training (though you can leave secondary school at the age of 16). But for many other things the minimum legal age is 16. We’ve taken a look at the law in England and Wales in some of these cases. Almost all of the information in this article was originally sourced from a House of Commons Library briefing. Both the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Children Act 1989 define a child as someone under the age of 18. The UN Convention adds that this is “unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.” In the UK, children gain rights under certain laws before the age of 18. If you’re in England or Wales, you can vote in UK elections, and referendums, from the age of 18. You can register to vote at 16. You can leave home without parental consent at the age of 18. If a child leaves home, parents can apply for a court order to try and bring the child back. The court bases its decision on criteria including the age and wishes of the child, as well as any risks to their welfare in leaving home. In practice, it is unlikely that a court would approve a parental order to bring back a child aged 16 or over. Children can generally start to take up take up part-time work at 13 years old. In exceptional cases such as if you are acting or modelling you may start at a younger age. If that is the case then a special licence is needed. From the age of 16 you can start full-time work in Wales, having met the minimum school leaving age. In England you have to stay in some kind of education or training until you're 18 and we've looked at that in more detail below. At the age of 16 you may need to be paid through PAYE if you earn over £113, meaning you can be taxed. You also start paying national insurance from the age of 16 if you earn over £157 a week (as an employee). You can legally get married, or enter into a civil partnership at 16, although parental consent must be given in both cases if you are under the age of 18. From the age of 16, a person is considered to be able to give consent to all sexual activity with other people aged 16 or over. It is an offence for someone who is under or over the age of 16 to take part in sexual activity with someone else who is under the age of 16. You have to be 18 years-old to buy alcohol. But if you are over the age of 16 you can drink beer, wine or cider with a meal, for example in a restaurant, if you’re accompanied by someone over the age of 18. Children can also consume alcohol in private from the age of five.   You can also buy liqueur confectionery from the age of 16. You can get a provisional driving license and start taking lessons at 15 years and 9 months. The minimum age for actually being able to drive depends on the type of vehicle. For some very small vehicles, for example a moped, you can start driving once you’re 16. You can take your driving test for a car, and start driving, from the age of 17. That’s also the minimum age limit for driving a tractor or a motorbike too. If you want to drive a “medium-sized good vehicle” then you need to be 18 and you have to be 21 before you can drive vehicles larger than that. There are some exceptions to the minimum age limits though. For example, if you have applied for the advanced rate of the mobility component of Personal Independence Payment you can start driving a car at 16 years-old. You can join any of the Armed Forces without parental consent once you reach 18. You can apply to the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force at 15 years and 9 months and the Army at 15 years and 7 months.  You can’t actually serve in any of the forces until you reach 16 though. For all three forces you need consent to join from a parent or guardian if you’re under 18. A parent usually gets child benefit until the end of August after their child turns 16. They can continue to get the benefit until the child reaches the age of 20 if they are in full-time “non-advanced education” or “approved training”—this includes GCSEs, A-levels, BTECs, and traineeships. Or they can get it until the child turns 17 if the child has registered for things like further education or training with a careers service. Correction 2 February 2018  We corrected this article to clarify that you can work full-time from the age of 16 in Wales, but in England must stay in some kind of education or training until the age of 18.","Correct, although in some cases parental consent is still required for under-18s.

30,fullfact,"There was a major increase in the number of “short” positions taken by UK hedge funds when Boris Johnson ran for Conservative leader.
","An article in the Byline Times, which has been shared tens of thousands of times on social media, makes a series of claims about donors to Vote Leave and Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign standing to profit from a no deal Brexit. But at least one key part of the article—a claim that the number of “short positions” taken by hedge funds increased dramatically in the lead up to Boris Johnson’s election as Conservative leader—seems likely to be based on a misunderstanding of the data. In reality, no such spike in the number of short positions seems to have occurred. A “short position” is effectively a bet that the price of a particular share will fall in the near future. For example an investor or fund will borrow a number of shares in a company from another investor, typically paying them some interest for the privilege. They then sell those shares on to a third party. If the share price then falls, they can then buy the same number of shares for the new lower price, return them to the original investor they borrowed them from, and will have made a profit on the difference.  A firm taking out such a short position has to register that with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) if the net value of the shares they are “shorting” exceeds 0.2% of the value of the company. Any shorting above 0.5% of the value of the company is made publicly available. A key premise of the Byline Times article is that the number of “short” positions taken out by UK firms dramatically increased after Boris Johnson announced his candidacy for the Conservative leadership, and reached a peak in the week that he was announced as the winner. We think they’ve made a mistake in this analysis: they only looked at the short positions that were still active at the time they gathered the data. By their nature, short positions may only last for a relatively brief period of time, after which the borrowed shares are returned. The data the FCA provides is split into two parts: “current”, which lists all the positions still active, and “historic”, which lists the positions where the transaction had ended or the number of shares being shorted has since changed. If you only look at the “current” data, then you’re obviously going to see a larger number of short positions in recent weeks compared to many months ago: the older positions will have ended or been altered since. We don’t know quite when Byline Times gathered the data they used, but using the most recent “current” data—going up to 8 September—produces a graph that looks very similar in shape to the one in their article: But if you include all the historical data as well, then you don’t see any such spike for the period covered by the Byline Times article: This apparent error has also been pointed out by several journalists on Twitter, including  Louis Goddard of Global Witness and Luke Bailey of the i. We asked Byline Times to share the data they used; they told us they would be publishing another article explaining their methodology, which they subsequently did. The article says they were “seeking to understand why” others could not replicate their findings. Byline Times suggested the reason may be because “Byline Times counted the number of position holders taking out positions, not the number of short positions” (despite the graphs in original article claiming they showed the “number of short positions”). They also said that they excluded all non-UK firms from their data. We don’t think that these factors are sufficient to explain the discrepancy; even just looking at a small number of UK firms and counting the number of position holders produces figures larger than some of the weeks shown in their graphs. We asked Byline Times to share the list of UK firms they were working from, and would suggest that doing so would help others assess their work. This is not the only potential issue with the article. The article also claims that the UK firms taking out those short positions were “almost entirely dominated” by firms that had either “directly, or through their directorships of other companies” donated to the Vote Leave campaign. We have asked Byline Times for more information on which firms they consider to have been direct or indirect Vote Leave donors; they told us they would not release this information for “legal reasons” because they had not contacted those firms. Their follow-up article does not detail the methodology they used to identify these firms as direct or indirect donors. The Financial Times has also raised a number of issues with the article, notably with the premise that a short position is necessarily a “bet on no deal” as the article suggests. For example, they point out that some companies would likely benefit from a no deal Brexit; shorting them would be effectively be betting against no deal.","We cannot identify any such increase; this seems to be an error caused by looking at incomplete data.

106,fullfact,"In January 2020 a new EU law means anyone who has an offshore bank account will have to “come clean so we can see how much they are hiding”.
","“come January 2020 the EU are bringing in a law saying that anyone who has a Off shore account will have to come clean so we can see how much they are hiding and to see if it can be taxed. No longer being able to get away with tax avoidance & evasion is what Brexit is about” Terry Christian, 1 September 2019 A widely-shared tweet by the broadcaster Terry Christian claims that the EU is bringing in a law in 2020 which will mean anyone with an offshore account will have to “come clean” and potentially have their income taxed. Avoiding this, he claims, is “what Brexit is about”. The tweet has been shared over 10,000 times, and screenshots of it have also circulated on Facebook. It’s unclear exactly which law Mr Christian is referring to—there are a couple of laws he could mean. However, we can’t find any interpretation of this claim that would make it correct. We’ve found two sets of EU laws (relating to tax avoidance and money laundering) that we think he could be referring to, as at least some parts come into place in January 2020. However, neither of these forces the owners of offshore accounts to “come clean” as the tweet describes. One possibility is that he is referring to the EU’s new “anti tax avoidance directive”, the last part of which has to be applied in member states by 1 January 2020 (although it’s unclear if they will still take effect if we leave with no deal at the end of October). However, its purpose is not to reveal money hidden in offshore accounts. The directive has five key legal aspects relating to: Broadly, the new directive is intended to prevent corporate tax avoidance practices, and has been planned since 2015. It “aims to address situations where corporate groups take advantage of disparities between national tax systems” to reduce the amount of tax they have to pay. In practice, this aims to tackle large companies shifting profits from the EU country in which they were made to a country with a lower tax rate or “preferential” rules. This could be another EU country, or a non-EU country. So these policies are about tightening up “systemic issues” to do with tax law in EU countries, to make it harder for companies to practice what the EU calls “aggressive tax planning”. Three of the five provisions of the new tax avoidance directive are already in place, with EU countries (including the UK) having to adopt them by 31 December 2018. HMRC told us that the new EU rules on interest restriction and the general anti-abuse rule led to no changes in the UK, because the UK’s existing rules already met or exceeded the minimum standards set. There were some minor changes made to controlled foreign companies rules, but none were expected to have any significant impact on individuals or the economy. The two EU provisions not yet in place are on exit tax and hybrid mismatches. The UK must meet the EU’s new standards on these by the start of 2020. HMRC told us the exit tax rules would lead to two “minor” changes. It’s also possible Mr Christian was referring to another EU policy coming into force next January: the fifth anti-money laundering directive. This will require member states to put mechanisms in place to identify ownership information on bank and payment accounts and safe-deposits. The EU told us that this does not cover bank accounts held outside the EU.     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as false        because there is no such EU law coming into place.    ","Incorrect. There is no such EU law coming into place.

121,fullfact,"The survival rate for Covid-19 is 98.54% in the UK.
","We’ve seen a number of Facebook posts claiming that the “current survival rate” for Covid-19 is 98.54% in the UK. These posts have been shared over 14,000 times. This is wrong. The figure seems to come from a Facebook post that made the same claim about the US survival rate back in April.  But we don’t yet know the true survival rate there or in the UK, as we don’t have a good idea of how many people have had Covid-19. There’s a lot we don’t know about the exact death toll either, which we’ve written more about here. Fact checkers in the US have reported on the 98.54% claim. It is actually an over-estimate of how many people have had a confirmed case of Covid-19 and have not died at this time. But describing that as the “survival rate” has problems. We can calculate this by looking at the case fatality rate, which is the percentage of deaths in patients who had the disease out of the number of confirmed cases. In the US, it’s currently at roughly 6%, meaning around 94% of those who’ve had confirmed cases so far have not died. As other fact checkers have pointed out, although a rate of survival around 95% sounds high, this would still make Covid-19 more lethal than seasonal flu. In the UK, at the time of writing, there have been 246,406 confirmed cases of Covid-19. There have been 34,796 Covid-19 associated deaths, meaning people who died having had a positive test result for Covid-19. From this, the case fatality rate in the UK is around 14%, meaning 86% have “survived”. This shouldn’t be directly compared with the figure for the US above, due to major differences between how widespread testing is. But this figure can’t be considered a ‘survival rate’ as we don’t know how many of those who have tested positive have fully recovered, how many are still ill, and how many might still die in the future. The “true” survival rate at the moment will be higher than any figure derived from the case fatality rate, as this is based on cases confirmed by testing, and not everyone who has had the virus will have been tested.     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as partly false        because we don’t yet know the survival rate in the UK, and this figure originated in the US.

European patent 3172319B1 is a vaccine for the new coronavirus.
","A post shared hundreds of times on Facebook claims the new coronavirus is patented, and that there is already a vaccine patented and owned by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The implication of the post seems to be that the new coronavirus and a vaccine were manufactured before the outbreak. These claims, and the implication of the post, are wrong. We’ve seen no credible evidence that Covid-19 was man-made. The US patent mentioned in the post—US2006257852—has nothing to do with the new coronavirus outbreak. It’s a patent issued in 2006 for a range of approaches to detecting, treating and preventing SARS (the severe acute respiratory syndrome of which there were outbreaks between 2002 and 2004), according to the US National Library of Medicine. It has been abandoned, so isn’t currently active.

This patent is still active. Again, this is not related to the new coronavirus outbreak. It’s for a vaccine for a virus which infects birds, which is another type of coronavirus. Speaking to journalists in France, the proprietor of the patent said: “The European patent EP3172319B1 was not filed in relation to novel virus SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the current COVID-19 pandemic. “The Institute was granted this patent in 2018 for a new approach to vaccine development in order to make improved infectious bronchitis virus vaccines for poultry. There are no plans for its use in human coronavirus vaccine development.” The Facebook post goes on to claim that the owner of this patent is a corporation owned by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Speaking to journalists in France, the proprietor of the patent said: “The European patent EP3172319B1 was not filed in relation to novel virus SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the current COVID-19 pandemic. “The Institute was granted this patent in 2018 for a new approach to vaccine development in order to make improved infectious bronchitis virus vaccines for poultry. There are no plans for its use in human coronavirus vaccine development.” The Facebook post goes on to claim that the owner of this patent is a corporation owned by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The owner is the Pirbright Institute, based near Woking. As we’ve fact checked recently, it receives some funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but isn’t owned by them and receives funding from a range of other sources.     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as false        because the patents mentioned do not relate to the new coronavirus and the owner of the vaccine patent is not owned by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.    ","
 
It is not. The patent is owned by the UK-based Pirbright Institute, which receives some of its funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

107,fullfact,"A post claims that the 1918 influenza out had a deadly second wave after quarantine restrictions were lifted.
","A Facebook post warning “humanity should never allow a repeat of the same mistake in 1918” has been shared thousands of times on Facebook.  The post reads “The most severe pandemic in history was the Spanish Flu of 1918. It lasted for 2 years, in 3 waves with 500 million people infected and 50 million deaths. Most of the fatalities happened in the 2nd wave. The people felt so bad about the quarantine and social distancing measures that when they were first lifted, the people rejoiced in the streets without abandon. In the coming weeks, the 2nd wave occurred, with tens of millions dead.” The claims in the post about 1918 are a mixture of accurate and inaccurate.  The 1918 influenza outbreak or the “Spanish flu” spread across the world in between 1918 and 1919, and is generally believed to have infected 500 million people and killed 50 million, making it the deadliest pandemic of modern times, (the black death is thought to have killed more.) It is also correct to say most of the fatalities happened in the second wave of the virus. The graph shown in the post is a commonly used graphic when talking about the three waves of the Spanish flu. We believe it shows weekly influenza mortality figures for England and Wales, rather than global figures—it appears to come from this scientific paper, which in turn adapted it from this 1927 book, which sourced the data from a 1920 report by the General Register Office.  However, it’s incorrect to say the lifting of quarantine and social distancing measures was what led to the second wave. In reality, across the world, public health measures greatly varied, with parades still being held in Autumn 1918, at the height of the second wave. In the US, quarantine measures were implemented during the second wave.  The reason why there was a second wave of the flu is still debated, but is usually more associated with broader public health policy failures, and issues related to the war, such as soldiers travelling across Europe. Some suggest that the virus may have mutated into a deadlier strain between the first and second wave, but this remains uncertain. The post might be referring to an infamous incident that happened with a parade in Philadelphia during the 1918 pandemic, although again, this didn’t happen because of quarantine being lifted.

31,fullfact,"Half of adults are now being paid by the state.
","“More than half of all adults now paid by the state” Daily Telegraph, 5 May 2020 “27m total UK adults receiving state help” Daily Express page 6, 7 May 2020 Calculations from the Telegraph recently, which were also reported in the Daily Express and elsewhere, suggested more than half of UK adults are now paid by the state, due in part to the government’s financial support for workers during the coronavirus pandemic and a higher number of benefit claims. But while the numbers used in the calculation are broadly accurate, there are too many ways to interpret this for any single answer to be meaningful. To reach a figure of 27 million people, the Telegraph added up the number of people who either: All that is out of about 53 million adults in the UK. The individual numbers used are broadly accurate (the unemployment level was slightly higher pre-crisis at about 1.3 million).  But there are some problems adding up the figures in this way which mean the figure of 27 million is not a precise estimate for the number of people who are paid by the state. For example it combines payments that go to individuals (like public sector salaries) and payments that can go to couples (like Universal Credit), but still counts these as individual people. Also it assumes that all unemployed people before the crisis started received benefits which isn’t necessarily the case. It also won’t necessarily include all people who aren’t technically unemployed but who receive support, such as through disability payments.  The Express reported this as 27 million adults who “receive state help”, which is potentially misleading. It implies all of these people are receiving benefits of some kind, when at least five million of it is just public sector workers earning their normal salaries. Putting everything else aside, there’s the question as to who you count as being “paid by the state” which is difficult to answer, because there are lots of different ways you could define it. The Telegraph includes people who are receiving certain types of benefits, but you could include people who are receiving any kind of state benefit, or just those who receive most or all their income from state benefits.  Pensioners, for example, might also argue that they paid in National Insurance, and so their state pension is no more being paid “by the state” than their private pension is being paid “by Aviva.” It’s also not straightforward to count public sector workers. If you start including workers directly employed by the state (as the Telegraph did), then why not include those who work for companies paid by public contracts? Is a cleaner employed by a building management company in the Department for Education being “paid by the state”?    So this sort of calculation basically becomes an exercise of picking and choosing what you want to count, with the end result not necessarily all that meaningful to anyone. And even if you could agree on the definition, the figures aren’t always readily available to do the sums.  As mentioned, some figures are available for family units, some for individuals, and it's hard to disentangle people who might count as being “paid by the state in different ways” (such as someone over-65 who receives a state pension but is still working and has been furloughed).  In other words, someone who’s counted among the 12.6 million pension claimants may also count in some of the other categories. Taking just employees, for example, we know that 5.4 million people worked in the public sector at the end of last year. 6.3 million jobs have been furloughed since the lockdown began, according to HMRC, as part of the government’s Job Retention Scheme. These will predominantly be private sector workers, as public organisations are not expected to furlough workers and are given guidance accordingly. So while not a perfect comparison, it would have been more meaningful to say the number of employees paid predominantly by the state had roughly doubled since the lockdown began. Since the Telegraph’s calculation, the number of furloughed workers is even higher. There’s also been a surge in claims for Universal Credit. In February 2020, before the lockdown began, about 2.9 million people were claiming Universal Credit. The government announced on 6 May that around 1.8 million claims had been made to the benefit since the lockdown was announced in mid-March.  This still doesn’t tell us to what extent different households are dependent on these benefits for their income. Before the lockdown, a majority of UK families received some kind of state support. In 2018/19, 51% of families (“benefit units”) in the UK received some kind of benefit or tax credit from the state—pensions and Child Benefit were the most widely claimed. (This doesn’t include people employed by the state.) Most families receive a relatively small amount of support. If you just look at families who got at least £10,000 a year from the state, the proportion falls to 22% .As the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out last year, about 1.8 million working-age households (8.5% of all such households) rely on benefits for at least 80% of their income, although over the longer term, many more households will rely on the state at some point, for example after people become parents. We won’t know how figures like these have changed since the lockdown began for some time yet.","There are too many ways to interpret this for any single answer to be meaningful.

32,fullfact,"15,000 passengers are arriving into the UK daily at the moment.
","Matt Hancock: “The number of people coming through has dropped very dramatically, as so there is very very low amounts—” Piers Morgan: “How many have come in this week?” Matt Hancock: “It’s about 15,000 a day at the moment from the data that [interrupted]” Good Morning Britain, 16 April 2020 The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, claimed in mid-April that airport passenger arrivals into the UK have fallen to as low as 15,000 a day amid the UK’s Covid-19 lockdown. We have been unable to find evidence to support this claim. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) failed to substantiate the claim made by Matt Hanock on ITV’s Good Morning Britain when we asked them. The Home Office has told Full Fact that it didn’t recognise the figure used by Mr Hancock and believed it was wrong, but wasn’t able to provide any alternative estimates when we asked for them. When we questioned several government departments about the figures, no one was able to provide an answer for where they came from. The DHSC did not respond to our questions. Data on how many people are arriving at the UK’s airports is hard to come by. We’ve no reason to dismiss the Health Secretary’s figure out of hand, but until the government can explain why Mr Hancock said what he did, we’ve no good reason to put any weight in the figure he gave either. We spoke to Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester Airports Group and none would provide specific data on daily passenger numbers, with some mentioning this could be commercially sensitive. It’s possible that Mr Hancock’s figure does use data provided directly by airports. Anecdotally, it was clear that passenger numbers had fallen to a small fraction of their usual levels. Heathrow Airport—which usually accounts for over a quarter of all passengers at UK airports—normally sees about 6.5 million passengers in March, but this year that had fallen by over half to three million. Heathrow has released a forecast saying it expects passenger demand in April to fall by 90% compared to the previous year—which would imply monthly passenger numbers in the region of 680,000, or between 20,000 and 25,000 a day (although some of these will be transfers and departures). This is just telling us about April as a whole, rather than recent days specifically.  There’s nothing concrete enough here to tell us very much about Mr Hancock’s claim, but it seems plausible that his figures resemble the scale of what’s happening. Most airports release passenger data on a monthly basis, so by the middle of next month we’ll have a clearer picture of the overall number of passengers at airports since the start of April. As for the reasons why, airports told us that passengers were not travelling for holidays, and said flights were still generally open for essential travel for key workers, repatriation flights and cargo. Heathrow Airport says: “All of our terminals remain open on a scaled down basis as we help with the repatriation of British citizens and the transport of vital air cargo. Vital medical equipment and supplies, including ventilators and medicines, as well as food are being flown via Heathrow, helping to combat the impacts of the global pandemic”. The real trouble will be learning how many people are arriving in the UK for each reason, as the usual means of doing this—the International Passenger Survey—has been suspended in light of the pandemic. In the absence of this data, there is still some information on the reasons for travel.  The volume of repatriations to the UK alone will have been significant in recent weeks. On 23 March, when the lockdown began, the government advised all British travellers to return to the UK. To get a sense of the scale of that undertaking, the average number of UK residents on overnight stays abroad on any given day was about 1.6 million (based on the latest data from January to March 2018).  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed to us that since the outbreak began, it estimates over 1.3 million people have returned to the UK via commercial routes. It said as well as helping to keep air traffic routes open, it has brought back over 13,200 people on 63 flights it has organised, and assisted 19,000 cruise ship passengers’ return. Cargo flights have also increased to fill some of the gaps left by falls in passenger demand. Heathrow alone says it has seen a 200% increase in cargo-only flights per week. The Office for National Statistics, which runs the International Passenger Survey, told us it was working on finding alternative sources of data for information on the reasons people are travelling, such as exit checks data gathered by the Home Office or administrative data from the Department for Work and Pensions.","The government hasn’t yet provided any evidence to back this up, and the Home Office has said it does not recognise the figure and that in their view it is wrong.

33,fullfact,"A survey found 11% of workers who report having taken a financial hit from the coronavirus pandemic have been evicted.
","“A third of workers have already taken a financial hit from the coronavirus pandemic, a poll showed tonight…Shockingly, 11% say they have been evicted from their homes – despite the temporary ban on rental evictions.”  Daily Mirror, 26 March 2020 Given the economic impact of Covid-19, concern has been raised that evictions during this period could leave people extremely vulnerable.  One statistic reported in the Daily Mirror was that 11% of UK workers who have taken a financial hit from the pandemic report having been evicted from their homes, despite a ban on evictions. While experts say that evictions have increased due to the coronavirus pandemic, this figure vastly overestimates the likely scale of the increase. The underlying data comes from a survey commissioned by campaign group Compassion in Politics. It commissioned research agency Opinium to survey a representative group of UK adults between 20-24 March who were working prior to the new coronavirus outbreak. Of those who said that their work was impacted by the new coronavirus, 11% said they had been evicted. This accounts for 4% of everyone who was in employment before the outbreak.  With 33 million people employed in the UK in January this year, this would equate to around 1.3 million workers being evicted (to say nothing of their families).  This number far exceeds the housing charity Shelter’s figure of 20,000 formal evictions (though this doesn’t include informal evictions which don’t involve any court proceedings), which is based on ongoing eviction cases in the courts which began before the government’s recent ban on evictions. Those are taking place due to all reasons, and not just coronavirus-related ones.  Grantley White Senior Research Executive at Opinium told us: “When it comes to the exact number of evictions taking place, this is a number that will be hard to understand for a number of methodological reasons. Nonetheless, we would expect that Shelter’s figures are very close to being an accurate representation because they will be using a methodology specifically designed to establish such detailed figures - our survey was aimed at capturing broader trends.” We asked Shelter about the number of recent evictions and a spokesperson told us: “Anecdotal evidence plus our experience researching housing and homelessness, and the private rented sector particularly, tell us that there almost certainly has been a spike in formal and informal evictions in the period just before the Government’s protections come into force. “However the level reported in this story and by the Opinium poll does not intuitively feel right.” Shelter added: “It seems clear to us that there has been some misunderstanding of this question by respondents and that perhaps fears of not being able to afford to pay for their housing, have in some cases got mixed up with actual eviction. “This is not to say that we are not extremely concerned about a probable rise in evictions as the implications of the virus on the UK have been becoming clear.”","Housing charity Shelter says there has been a spike in evictions, though not nearly as large a spike as this survey found.

34,fullfact,"Licensed gambling has grown 57% over the last decade.
","“Licensed gambling has grown by 57% over the last decade boosted by online and smartphone access.” BBC News, 28 February 2020 Last week the National Audit Office published a report scrutinising the operation of the Gambling Commission, the UK’s gambling regulator. The BBC reported one of the figures in the report, that “licensed gambling has grown by 57% over the last decade”. But this figure needs some important context to understand it. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the amount of gambling has grown by that amount.  Firstly, it’s worth noting that the NAO figures show that the yield from licensed gambling (which is the revenue generated minus the winnings paid out) grew by 40% in the decade to 2018/19. The figure reported by the BBC, of 57% growth over that period, is the figure after excluding the National Lottery, as the NAO report makes clear. More importantly, this shouldn’t be taken to mean that people are gambling more, because much of this growth comes from changes to the regulation of online gambling in 2014. Before November 2014, online gambling based outside of Great Britain did not need to be licensed and regulated and so revenue from that did not show up in the Gambling Commission’s figures before then.  In 2013/14, the last full year before the regulation change, the gross gambling yield from online gambling was £1.2 billion, and had been between £700 million and £1 billion for a few years. (These figures are adjusted for inflation, so they reflect the change in the value of money over time.) Then in 2014/15 (the year the regulations changed), the yield from online gambling doubled to £2.4 billion. In 2015/16, the first full year the new regulations were active, the yield was £4.5 billion. Online gambling yield has continued to increase since then, but at a slower rate, to £5.3 billion in 2018/19. If you look at the change in the gambling yield excluding online gambling, it’s actually fallen by 2%  over the last decade, from £9.3 billion to £9 billion. So the boom observed in the past decade may have been created largely by the change in regulations, not by a real change in people’s behaviour. We don’t know how much it would have grown if online gambling had been classified consistently across that time. This is further supported by the evidence on gambling behaviour.    The Gambling Commission runs an annual survey which suggests that the amount of gambling taking place isn’t increasing much. In 2015, 45% of respondents said they had gambled in the four weeks prior to being surveyed. In 2019 the figure was 47%. Also the frequency of gambling appears to be decreasing over time. Fewer people reported gambling at least once a week, while the proportion saying they gamble more than once a month, but less the once a week, has increased.  The Gambling Commission doesn’t ask people how much they spend on average, but data from the Office for National Statistics also suggests  this hasn’t changed much either in recent years and has fallen over the longer term.  Over roughly the same period that licensed gambling yield increased by 40% , the average household spend on gambling fell 33%. Both figures are adjusted for inflation. ","Gambling yield has grown 57% over the last decade if you exclude the National Lottery. Including the National Lottery it has grown 40%. However, this growth is largely due to the changes in how online gambling is classified. This growth doesn’t necessarily mean people are gambling more.

35,fullfact,"Bus fares have gone up by 60% since 2010.
","“Bus fares have gone up by 60% since 2010.” Lisa Nandy MP, 11 February 2020 Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy claimed on Twitter that bus fares have gone up by 60% since 2010. This is correct based on one measure for buses and coaches, though there are other figures which show a smaller increase. This figure also doesn’t account for the change in wages over this period so it doesn’t really show how much more affordable or unaffordable buses have become.  Lisa Nandy’s office told us she was quoting the figure from a report by the Campaign for Better Transport. This data was originally published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and shows that between December 2009 and December 2019, the cost of bus and coach fares increased by 59% in cash terms, so not taking inflation into account.  But figures on the cost of bus fares (excluding coaches) are also published by the Department of Transport. These show fares increased by around 37% across Great Britain between 2010 and 2019. Although neither of these figures is very useful if you want to understand how much bus fare increases hit people’s pockets. For that you need to compare the increase in bus fares to the increase in wages over the same period.    Since 2010, average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain increased 24% in cash terms. This is slower than both the increase in just bus fares (37%), and bus and coach fares together (59%) over roughly the same period.   It’s also worth noting that, since 2010, the price of goods and services on average has increased by 22% (using the CPIH inflation measure). So the cost of bus and coach travel has increased far more than other products.   ","Correct, looking at one measure which includes coach fares too. However, this increase doesn’t factor in the rise in wages over the same period.

36,fullfact,"Scotland has the highest taxes anywhere in Europe.
","“They (Scotland) have the highest taxes anywhere in Europe” Boris Johnson, 4 September 2019 (23:35) At his first Prime Minister’s Questions, Boris Johnson said that Scotland has the highest taxes anywhere in Europe. We asked the Prime Minister’s office what tax he is referring to but have not received a reply. (Channel 4 News also did not get an official response.) Over half of all tax revenue in Scotland is controlled by the UK government, but one of the main taxes set by the Scottish government is income tax. If Mr Johnson is talking about income tax, then this claim is incorrect. Many European countries have higher rates of income tax than Scotland. Additionally, Scotland’s income tax rates are very similar to the rest of the UK’s—and people earning below around £27,000 pay less income tax in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. If he’s referring to a different tax, then he should specify this, as otherwise it’s impossible for the public to guess what exactly he’s referring to. And regardless, we can see no feasible way his claim could be correct. In Scotland, you pay no income tax on earnings below £12,500 (the same as in the rest of the UK). You then pay: The rates in the rest of the UK are marginally different. Roughly speaking, people in Scotland pay less income tax than the rest of the UK on earnings below £27,000 a year, and more income tax on earnings above that. The differences are relatively marginal though. Someone earning £14,500 a year would pay around £20 a year less in income tax in Scotland, compared to the rest of the UK. Someone earning £28,000 a year (roughly average earnings in the UK) would pay around £10 a year more in income tax in Scotland. Someone earning £40,000 a year would pay around £130 a year more in income tax in Scotland. Someone earning £100,000 a year would pay just over £2,000 a year more in income tax in Scotland. This doesn’t factor in national insurance contributions, which are the same in Scotland as in the rest of the UK. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has compared income tax rates in the UK with a select number of European countries. They looked at data for 2016—the latest available figures for an international comparison—and found that a median full-time employee (earning around £28,000 a year) in the UK paid less income tax than in many other major European economies. A non-exhaustive list of countries where more tax was paid includes Denmark, Belgium, Finland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, and Spain. In 2016, people in Scotland paid exactly the same income tax as people in the rest of the UK. Today someone earning £28,000 in Scotland would pay slightly more income tax than in the rest of the UK. But these differences are not great, meaning the countries listed above have a higher income tax rate than Scotland. If you also include employee-funded social security contributions (the equivalent of paying national insurance), France and Austria also have a higher tax rate than Scotland or the rest of the UK, but Sweden and Spain don’t. The picture is roughly the same for much higher earners too. The IFS’s findings show that a top earner (£344,000 a year) in the UK in 2016 would pay less in income tax than in Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Germany, Spain, Austria and Finland. Once you factor in social security contributions, they would also pay less than in Belgium. Today, high earners in Scotland pay slightly more income tax than in the rest of the UK, but Scotland’s rate would still be lower than in most (if not all) of the countries mentioned above. We’ve asked the Prime Minister’s office whether he was referring to income taxes, or something else. But if he was referring to something else, not specifying what tax he was talking about is, at best, misleading. The Institute for Government calculates that 43% of tax revenue in Scotland is controlled by the devolved government in Scotland (with the rest controlled by the UK government). In addition to income tax, that includes things like duty land tax and landfill tax. We’ve not seen any evidence that Scotland has the highest taxes in Europe for any of these things, and it would be hard to make a fair comparison anyway, as each country has its own method of taxing things like land and council duties. Aside from income tax, one other major tax which is applied in a fairly uniform way across Europe is VAT. The standard VAT rate in the whole of the UK (including Scotland) is 20%. This is on the lower end of the spectrum among EU countries (where it varies from 17% to 27%).","Incorrect, a number of European countries have higher income tax rates than Scotland.

","“Tories' plan to raise the state pension age to 75 over the next 16 years EXCLUSIVE: Government will raise age of state pension from 67 to 75 based on think tank findings from Iain Duncan Smith” Daily Mirror, 17 August 2019 An (now corrected) article in the Mirror over the weekend claimed that the government planned to raise the state pension age to 75 over the next 16 years, based on the findings of a report by the Centre for Social Justice think tank. The Centre for Social Justice, which first proposed Universal Credit and is chaired by former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, did recommend that the State Pension Age be increased to 75 by 2035 in a new report. But it’s incorrect to suggest this proposal is government policy. We spoke to the Department for Work and Pensions, which told us that it’s not government policy to do this. The Mirror has corrected their headline today to reflect this fact. State pension age in the UK is currently a little over 65 for both men and women. By October 2020 it will have risen to 66, from 66 to 67 between the years 2026 and 2028, and then from 67 to 68 between 2044 and 2046.","This was recommended in a report by the Centre for Social Justice think tank.

38,fullfact,"Under the Conservatives, the state pension has risen by over £1,450.
","“What we have seen under Conservatives in government is the basic state pension rise by over £1,450 per year”. Theresa May, 3 April 2019 At Prime Minister’s Questions last week Theresa May said that under recent Conservative-led governments the basic state pension has increased by over £1,450 per year. That’s correct when looking just at the cash-value increase. In 2010/11, the basic state pension for an individual was around £5,080 per year. It is currently around £6,550—an increase of about £1,470 in cash terms. But this figure doesn’t account for the fact that prices have also risen over the last eight years, meaning with the same sum of money today, you can’t buy as much as you could eight years ago—an effect known as inflation. Factoring that in, since the Conservatives have been in government the basic state pension has increased by around £550 in today’s money. Change to the state pension isn’t the only thing that’s impacted pensioner incomes over this time. Changes to the level of things like benefits and private income have also had an effect. Between 2010/11 and 2017/18 the income of the average “pensioner unit” increased by £936 in real terms per year before taxes. That’s an increase of around 3%. (A pensioner unit is either a single pensioner or a couple of whom at least one is above pension age.) Of that £936, £416 was down to increases in state benefits (including but not limited to the state pension) while the rest was due to other incomes including private or occupational pensions. So since 2010/11, the average pensioner unit has seen an increase in their income of around 2% before taxes as a result of government changes to benefits.  ","In cash terms yes, the state pension has increased by £1,470 since 2010/11. But after accounting for inflation the increase is around £550.

39,fullfact,"National Insurance Contributions are being used to reduce the national debt.
","“Our NI payments being used to reduce the national debt, no wonder the UK pensions are so small” Facebook user, 18 January 2019 A viral post on social media claims UK adults’ National Insurance Contributions (NICs) are being used to pay off the national debt. This is, in part, correct, but it doesn’t affect the amount of pensions or benefits people get in return for their NICs. The source of the viral claims is a response from the Treasury to a freedom of information request earlier this year. In it the government confirms that some of the surplus money it gets in NICs is invested in order to help reduce the national debt. There’s a clear hint in the viral posts that spending some NICs on paying down the debt is an inappropriate use of the money, because it means the money isn’t being used on people’s pensions or benefits. Some of the NICs surplus could, in theory, be put towards increasing pensions or benefits payments. But it’s also important to be clear that no one is getting less than what they’re currently due in pensions or benefits as a result of this—the money that’s going towards the national debt is what’s left over in NIC payments after this year’s benefits and pensions have been paid. There’s also no question of future pensions being unavailable as a result of this. This is a long-running debate (the current law allowing this dates back to 1992). Arguments have been made for many years that the surplus would be better spent on increasing people’s pensions, while Conservative, Coalition and Labour governments have argued that it’s more prudent to keep the money in reserve and invest it in the meantime to help pay down the debt. The UK’s national debt is currently £1,800 billion and every year the UK pays about £40 billion in interest on that debt. NICs are paid by employees, employers and the self-employed in the UK and pay for contributory benefits, mainly the state pension. So for the most part, today’s workers are paying the pensions of today’s pensioners. Unlike most taxes in the UK, NICs are paid into a specific pot called the National Insurance Fund, rather than being put with the rest of the tax money collected for the Treasury. Huge sums of money flow into and out of this fund every year. In 2017/18, about £100 billion went in via NIC contributions and about £100 billion left the fund again to pay for benefits. But the fund doesn’t always end up in balance. In some years, it needs to pay out a little more in benefits than it gets in contributions—a deficit. In other years, it pays out less than it receives—meaning it’s in surplus. When the fund is in surplus, that money is usually kept in the fund effectively as a reserve, to make sure there is enough money to pay for things like benefits and pensions in years when there’s a deficit. But the government doesn’t just leave that reserve pot alone. It invests it in the UK’s national debt, effectively reducing the debt. In its response to a freedom of information request earlier this year the government said: “The latest National Insurance Fund Accounts show that the balance of the NIF increased by [£2 billion] in 2017/18…. This resulted in a closing balance of [£24 billion], which was paid into the [National Insurance Fund] Investment Account and, in practice, used to reduce the national debt”. The House of Commons Library says in its briefing on National Insurance, “Since 2007 the Fund has been invested in the Government’s ‘Call Notice Deposit Account’, administered by the Debt Management Office… It is worth emphasizing that these funds are being held in this account on loan… there is no question of the Government being in a position to use this facility to extract money from the Fund as an extra source of revenue.” Even though there’s a specific pot of money for NI funds to flow into and out of, it’s not helpful—as the Insitute for Fiscal Studies has argued in the past— to think of this as a ring-fenced sum that’s separate from the rest of the government’s money. That’s because when the fund runs low (after, say, years of deficits in a row), the Treasury steps in and injects new money into the fund. And as mentioned above, the surpluses in the fund are also invested in the national debt. That means, in practice, some money flows into the fund that doesn’t come from NI contributions and some money flows out that doesn’t go to pensions or contributory benefits. In other words, whatever the amount of NI contributions the government raises in a given year, it always finds a way to pay the pensions and benefits it has to. The government can’t know exactly how much NIC income it will get in any one year, nor how much in pensions and benefits it will need to pay out. One of the roles of the Government’s Actuary is to help predict what will happen to the fund in future. According to a review in 2017, due largely to an ageing population and an increasing proportion of people claiming pensions, the fund isn’t sustainable in the long-term through NI contributions alone. That means it could need top-up money from the Treasury to keep pensions and benefits in payment, and that will come from general taxation. There may also need to be bigger changes—higher NI payments, lower pensions increases, and increases to the state pension age could all be factors.","Some are. This doesn’t mean anyone isn’t getting paid what they’re currently due in pensions or benefits—the UK government invests the NICs that don’t go towards paying pensions and benefits on reducing the national debt.

88,fullfact,"Universal Credit will mean 200,000 more people will be in work when it’s fully rolled-out.
","“When Universal Credit is rolled out fully, 200,000 more people will be in work”. Ross Thomson MP, 11 October 2018 This is what the government estimates will be the case by 2024/25. The suggestion is that 200,000 more people will be in work by that date than would have been the case if Universal Credit had never been introduced. But there are big doubts over this estimate: at the moment the government isn’t gathering enough evidence to know if this will ever be true. There are also uncertainties over whether the evidence that’s been gathered so far will be representative of future claims. Universal Credit is a new working-age benefit that is replacing a lot of existing social security benefits like income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance and Housing Benefit. It’s currently being rolled out in stages across different parts of the UK. The government started rolling it out in 2013, and it is expected to be fully in place across the country by 2023. In June this year, the government published its full business case into Universal Credit, examining what its expected costs and benefits would be. As the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions summarised in parliament: “when fully rolled out, Universal Credit is forecast to incentivise 200,000 more people to take employment than would have under the previous system and deliver £8bn of benefits to the UK economy per year.” The government’s basis for thinking the new benefit will increase employment comes from three things: The government estimates the first of these—the increased financial incentives—will account for over half of that 200,000 gain. Universal Credit is designed to make work more attractive to some claimants by taking less benefit income away when people start to work a small number of hours each week, through what’s called the “work allowance”. This incentive doesn’t apply to all claimants, though. Both the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and the Resolution Foundation have said that some groups—such as the second earner in a couple with children, or single parents—will have less of an incentive to work. This is because of things like the level the work allowance is set at, and the rate at which Universal Credit is reduced once the work allowance has been exceeded. Some people also face other barriers to moving into work, such as a having a disability. The National Audit Office (NAO) evaluated the government’s business case shortly after it was published, and expressed “significant doubt” about the main benefits of the policy. The first of these was over the evidence the government has gathered so far on the employment impacts. Analysis from a sample of claimants in 2017 showed those on Universal Credit were four percentage points more likely to be in work within six months of their claim being made than those on Jobseeker’s Allowance (one of the benefits being replaced). That offers some support for the government’s claims, but the NAO is cautious about taking this too far: “It is not known whether the employment impact identified by early evaluation can be replicated across the programme.” It says the claimants in this study were people with relatively simple needs with a lot of resources devoted to them. At the moment Universal Credit claimants are predominantly single people without children, and the incentives to work are different for different groups of claimants. For example, the structure of the benefit reduces the work incentive for the second earner in a couple. So there’s reason to doubt that the evidence on Universal Credit’s effects so far will be representative of future claims. 200,000 is actually the third version of a figure that’s been around since 2011. Back then the government thought 300,000 more households would move into work. In 2014 this was revised down to 250,000, and has now been reduced to 200,000. That’s partly down to policy changes over the period which have made the benefit less generous, such as reductions to the work allowance. Another factor has simply been because employment as grown and unemployment has fallen considerably over that period, “meaning it is now harder to get people into work”, according to the NAO. The other key problem with the government’s claim is that there’s no way to prove whether it will turn out to be true or not, because the government doesn’t have the right processes in place to gather evidence. The NAO said: “The Department will never be able to measure whether Universal Credit actually leads to 200,000 more people in work, because it cannot isolate the effect of Universal Credit from other economic factors in increasing employment”. It concluded starkly: “This, the extended timescales and the cost of running Universal Credit compared to the benefits it replaces cause us to conclude that the project is not value for money now, and that its future value for money is unproven.”","That’s according to the government’s own estimate, but it’s subject to significant doubt.

89,fullfact,"Universal Credit is working because over 3.3 million more people are in work since 2010.
","“We know that [Universal Credit] is working and getting people into work because our employment figures that came out yesterday show over 3.3 million more people in work since 2010.” Esther McVey MP, 17 October 2018 ""What we've done is look at the whole benefit system, how do we get people into work, 1,000 people each and every day. Those people will be on less benefit by the sheer nature that they’re now in work."" Esther McVey MP, 12 October 2018 Ms McVey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, has repeatedly linked welfare policies introduced under the Conservative and coalition governments since 2010 to there being 3 million more people in work. This is a misleading link to draw. The total number of people aged sixteen or over and in employment increased by 3.3 million between February-April 2010 (just before the coalition government took office) and June-August 2018 in the UK. But the increase in the total population aged sixteen or over was similar: 3 million. In short, having record numbers of people in work doesn’t sound as impressive when you consider there are record numbers of people. There are separate figures which do show employment has increased significantly under the coalition and Conservative governments: the percentage of 16-64 year-olds in employment has risen from 70% to 76% since 2010. However, there is not enough evidence available to know how strong the link is between welfare policies and employment. Ms McVey’s claim that 1,000 people a day have gone into work since 2010 is based on the increase in the total number of people in work. There were just under 3.3 million more people aged sixteen or over in work in June-August 2018 in the UK, compared to February-April 2010 (just before the coalition government came into office). That works out at around 1,000 more people in work every day. But it cannot be said that all of that increase is down to government welfare changes. A first main reason is that the number of people in work tends to naturally rise over time, and this will account for some of the increase. From February-April 2010 to June-August 2018, the UK population aged sixteen and over increased by 3 million. That increase is only slightly lower (300,000 people fewer) than the increase in the number of people of that age who are in employment. That doesn’t mean all but 300,000 of the increase in employment figures is down to population change. It won’t be, because not all of the 3 million people added to the population will be employed. Nonetheless, a significant portion of the increase in employment will just be reflected by the population increase. Using different figures, there is evidence that this government has been successful at getting more people into work. The “employment rate” is a better way of assessing the government’s record on increasing employment. It tells us what percentage of the population is in work, rather than the total number. The employment rate among those aged 16-64 has increased under the coalition and Conservative governments, rising from 70% in February-April 2010 to 76% in June-August 2018. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has called the rising employment rate “remarkable”, in the context of wider economic performance in the decade since the financial crash. But despite this rise, there is a second key problem with claiming that changing employment figures are down to welfare changes: we don’t have clear evidence for it. Universal Credit is the benchmark welfare policy of the Conservative and coalition governments since 2010, and Ms McVey has sometimes used it to mean “welfare reforms” in making the 1,000 people a day claim. The government argues that Universal Credit increases employment by making work more financially attractive than under previous benefits, has conditions which encourage benefit claimants to search for work, and has a smoother administrative process for claimants moving into work. If Ms McVey does mean Universal Credit when she says welfare reforms, then it certainly can’t have driven all the change in employment levels since 2010, as it was only introduced in 2013, and is still not in place across the whole of the UK. The government also argues that this will get 200,000 more people will be in work by 2024/25 (compared to ten years earlier). However, the National Audit Office says that, because of limitations in the methodology behind the government’s calculations, “the Department will never be able to measure whether Universal Credit actually leads to 200,000 more people in work”. They have also expressed “significant doubt” about the main benefits of Universal Credit. You can read our fuller assessment of that claim here. The bottom line is that we can’t say with any precision what is driving changes in employment and unemployment rates.

The new conditionality requirements for lone parents under Universal Credit will have a hugely disproportionate impact on women.
","“91% of lone parents are women. Does [the Minister of State for Disabled People, Health and Work] agree that the new conditionality requirements for lone parents under universal credit will have a hugely disproportionate impact on women?” Angela Crawley MP, 13 September 2018 Since April 2017, parents receiving Universal Credit have been required to start looking for work once their youngest child turns three. Previously, it was when the child turned five. This requirement only applies to a child’s designated “lead parent”. This means that, in a two-parent household in receipt of Universal Credit, the non-lead parent is expected to find work regardless of the child’s age. There is some evidence that the challenges in finding work “can be more acute” for single parents. Three-year olds are not eligible to attend primary school, and single parents are therefore likely to be responsible for all the logistics of arranging childcare, alongside looking for work. According to data for the UK from 2014, 91% of single parents with dependent children were women. It was still around this level in 2017. Universal Credit is a working-age benefit that is replacing a lot of existing social security benefits like income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance and Housing Benefit. The government started rolling it out in 2013, and it is expected to be fully in place across the country by 2022. For most claimants, their receipt of Universal Credit is conditional on meeting certain requirements. These largely relate to looking for work, or increasing your income from work. There are also specific conditions for families with children. All children have a nominated “lead carer”, and the age of the child affects what the lead carer has to do in order to receive Universal Credit. If the child is aged under one, the lead carer doesn’t have to look for work. Once the child turns one, the lead carer will be asked to attend “work focused interviews” to “discuss plans for a future move into work”. Once the child turns two, the lead carer has to “take active steps to prepare for work”, “which might include some training and work preparation activities”. When the child turns three, the lead carer is expected to work (or look for work) for a maximum of 16 hours a week. At the age of five, this rises to a maximum of 25 hours a week, and from thirteen years old it rises to 35 hours a week. The expectation that parents of three- and four-year olds look for work was introduced in April 2017. It was described by the charity Gingerbread (which works with single parent families) as “a significant change in that it is the first time that parents of pre-school aged children must look for work or risk being exposed to sanctions”. The age at which a child’s parent must find work if they are on various benefits has been decreasing: from 16 years old in 2008 to five years old by 2012. In a two-parent household, the conditionality requirements based on the child’s age only apply to the “lead carer”. The other parent is expected to find work regardless of the child’s age. Gingerbread argues that the challenges in finding work “can be more acute” for single parents, as they are likely to be responsible for all the logistics of dropping off and picking up a child from childcare, and childcare costs will take up a greater part of their income. Children in single-parent households are also around twice as likely to be in poverty as those in households with more than one adult, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). In response to Ms Crawley’s claim and question the government responded that “It is not until the youngest child in a family starts school that the job coach begins a conversation about the journey to work. It is not until the youngest child in a family is three that those conversations about getting into work begin to happen.” A child can start reception class in England at age four, and must begin primary school from age five. Parents of three- and four-year olds in England are normally entitled to between 15 and 30 hours of free childcare a week, depending on their circumstances, although the policy, introduced last September, has been criticised for involving extra costs for some parents. Ms Crawley argues that the challenges for single parents will primarily affect women, as 91% of single parents are women. Ms Crawley is referring to figures from 2014 published by the Office for National Statistics. In 2017, 90% of single parents with dependent children in the UK were women. 21% of dependent children lived in single parent families in the UK in 2017—virtually the same level as two decades before. The Women’s Budget Group, an independent network of researchers, policy experts and campaigners, has previously identified other ways in which women could be negatively affected by Universal Credit. For instance, it says that the practice of Universal Credit being a single monthly payment given to a couple could give abusive partners more opportunity to exert financial control over their partners.","
 
Since April 2017, the “lead parent” of a child has been required to work, or be looking for work, for up to 16 hours a week once the child turns three. Some research suggests this could be more challenging for single parents—the vast majority of whom are women.

91,fullfact,"Trussell Trust food bank use has increased by 52% in a year in areas where Universal Credit has been rolled out.
","“The Trussell Trust have told us that in areas where Universal Credit has been rolled out over a 12 month period that food bank use has increased by 52%.” Ian Blackford MP, 5 July 2018 This is correct according to the Trust’s own research. This doesn’t prove that Universal Credit has caused an increase on this scale, and the Trussell Trust itself says it isn’t the only benefit people at food banks are experiencing issues with. There’s wider evidence that people have had problems during the rollout of Universal Credit and that some have been going to food banks as a result. Universal Credit is a new working-age benefit that is replacing a lot of existing social security benefits like income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance and Housing Benefit. It’s currently being rolled out in stages across different parts of the UK, and all existing claimants of the old benefits are expected to be moved to the new system by 2022. Concerns have been raised that delays in moving claimants over to Universal Credit or administration problems may be causing some people to use food banks. The Trussell Trust is the UK’s largest network of food banks. The Trussell Trust confirmed to us from its own research that: “analysis of 38 foodbanks in our network that have been in full Universal Credit rollout areas for a year or more shows that these projects experienced an increase of 52% in the twelve months following the full rollout date in their area.” The Trust said it added up data from individual food banks in areas of the UK where Universal Credit had been rolled out and compared the change in usage after a year. The average increase was 52%. Meanwhile using a random sample of 247 food banks in areas without Universal Credit, or those where the rollout had only just started (for at most three months) the average increase was 13% over equivalent periods. We don’t know how these averages vary across different food banks. The National Audit Office has observed separately steeper increases in food bank use in three of the four areas it looked at where Universal Credit is being introduced. As we’ve looked into before, it’s as important to know what food bank figures don’t tell us as what they do. The Trussell Trust doesn’t run all food banks in the UK, for instance, so these findings are specific to the cases they’ve been able to measure. This is also still early days. We know that—by definition—the rollout areas covered in the study are among the earliest to receive Universal Credit. The benefit is currently claimed by an estimated 920,000 claimants and is expected to reach over eight million in total. The research showing a 52% increase can’t on its own prove that Universal Credit is the main driver of increased food bank use, though it’s still likely to be a major factor. The Trussell Trust has done wider work asking some of its users about their experience of Universal Credit and why it led them to use a food bank. This gives an insight into the problems some people are facing, and why they went to a food bank. But it isn’t necessarily a representative sample of Trussell Trust food bank users as a whole, which the Department for Work and Pensions has drawn attention to. The evidence from its referral agencies suggests in 2017/18 a growing proportion of referrals to food banks are because benefit payments aren’t seen to be covering the costs of essentials. 28% of referrals for which the Trust has data were due to ‘low income’—for which benefits were a significant factor—followed by benefit delays (24%) and benefit changes (18%). As the Trussell Trust also points out: “Universal Credit is not the only benefit people at food banks are experiencing issues with”. Research has also suggested people on disability benefits are more likely to visit food banks. The Department for Work and Pensions told us: “The reasons why people use food banks are complex, so it’s wrong to link a rise to any one cause”. It went on to say “Universal Credit is working for the vast majority who claim it”. The DWP also points out that the research, covering 2017/18, won’t reflect the impact of all of the changes introduced earlier this year to provide extra support to claimants and allowing access to a full month’s advance payment while waiting for an award. We won’t know what effect these have had until more research has been done and those changes have had time to bed down. The DWP’s own research shows that significant numbers of claimants report experiencing financial difficulties. It told us that 83% of claimants are satisfied with the service they receive, which is correct for people on the ‘live service’—a temporary part of the rollout in some areas that has more restrictions on who can claim, as opposed to the ‘full service’.  But as the National Audit Office drew attention to this week in an argument with the Secretary of State, it’s also the case from the DWP’s research that 40% of claimants on the ‘full service’ surveyed report experiencing significant financial difficulties eight to nine months into their claim. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Correct according to the Trust’s own research. It’s difficult to measure the extent that one is causing the other. There’s wider evidence that people have had problems during the rollout of Universal Credit and that some have been going to food banks as a result.

92,fullfact,"Universal Credit will make work pay.
","“Universal Credit will make work pay and increase financial incentives for people to work more” Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson, 3 February 2016 “Everyone can now see that successive cuts to universal credit have destroyed many of the work incentives that were supposed to be the very reason for the scheme, hitting single parents particularly hard.” Owen Smith MP, Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, 3 February 2016 Overall, Universal Credit—the new single payment replacing a range of existing benefits—will strengthen work incentives for people claiming the benefit, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. But certain groups will see their work incentives weakened. As the Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary says, single parents on average will see their incentive to work weakened. That’s because while on average they’ll get less either for being in work or out of work under the new system, the in-work support falls by more. The IFS says that this disincentive has increased after the level at which Universal Credit starts to be withdrawn for people in work was reduced in the budget last July. The new payment, designed to “ensure that work always pays” is being rolled out over the current Parliament. The IFS says that despite cuts to work allowances, mentioned by Mr Smith, overall Universal Credit will strengthen the financial incentive to work. Your work allowance is the amount you can earn before Universal Credit starts to be reduced. This is particularly the case for people who the IFS says face the weakest incentives under the system being replaced. While under the previous system 2.1 million people keep less than 30% of what they earn when they move into work, due to the loss of benefits and the payment of taxes, only 700,000 will do under Universal Credit. More than half of working-age people will see no change in their incentive to work under the new system, it says. The IFS says the biggest effect of Universal Credit is to strengthen the incentive for couples with children to have one person in the couple in paid work, as opposed to neither of them being in work. But the incentive for both people in the couple to be in work will be weakened. Overall, under the new system, single parents will have less incentive to be in work as they’ll have less support for being in work. This disincentive has grown since work allowances were reduced in the budget last July, the IFS has said. Previously, there has been a clear incentive for lone parents to work 16 hours a week, and little incentive to work more or less than this, the IFS says. As a result, it says that many currently work exactly 16 hours a week and few work less than this. Under the new system, single parents will get more support than under the previous system if they work fewer than 16 hours a week. They’ll also see their payments decline more slowly if they work more than 16 hours a week. This means that some single parents will choose to reduce or increase their hours due to these changes. The IFS’ analysis excludes the impact of other reforms such as the tax-free childcare scheme and transitional arrangements which ensure that families transferring from the previous system to the new one do not see any reduction in payments. So it shows the long-run impact of the changes rather than the immediate effect on households’ finances.","Overall, Universal Credit will strengthen work incentives for people claiming the benefit, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. But certain groups, such as single parents, will see their work incentives weakened.

40,fullfact,"Average pay has finally surpassed its pre-crisis peak.
","“Average UK wages top pre-financial crisis levels.” The Guardian, 18 February 2020 “Wages back above pre-economic crisis levels.” BBC News, 18 February 2020 “Average pay has finally surpassed its pre-crisis peak.” The Times, 18 February 2020 The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has published data on earnings which was reported widely across the media. The figures show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in December 2019 exceeded the previous peak reached in August 2007. This data is adjusted for the change in prices (inflation) meaning it reflects a real increase in the purchasing power of workers. The ONS does this by converting the earnings from each period into 2015 money. So the figures reflect the value of earnings in 2015, not what they actually are worth now or when they were being paid out. In December 2019 weekly earnings averaged £473.68 in 2015 money, higher than the previous peak of £473.33 in August 2007.      But there’s one thing to bear in mind with saying that pay is now at a record high. The figures reported by the media represent what’s called “regular pay”. This doesn’t include bonuses, and so doesn’t actually reflect the total average amount that all employees across the economy are earning. (Not all employees earn bonuses, but some do.) When you include bonuses, and look at “total pay”, the average weekly wage of £502.74 is still below the February 2008 peak of £522.15 (in 2015 money).","True, for average weekly earnings in GB, if you don’t count bonuses. Average weekly total earnings including bonuses is still below the pre-crisis peak.

","“The Government's own research says that Boris Johnson's Brexit proposals would lead to a 6.7% drop in GDP and 6.4% drop in real wages - the kind of hit to the economy experienced in the financial crash.”  Chuka Umunna, 18 October 2019 Mr Umunna was referencing economic analyses published by the government in November 2018, which modelled the economic outcomes under different Brexit scenarios. But he’s wrong to say GDP and real wages would “drop” according to this analysis and his comparison to the financial crash is misleading. The government estimated that a hypothetical free-trade agreement (FTA) with the EU where we maintained tariff-free access but there were still non-tariff costs (such as regulatory barriers) would cost the UK between 4.9% and 6.7% GDP growth after 15 years.  GDP (or Gross Domestic Product) is the total value of everything that happens within a country’s economy—the goods and services made and the money earned. It’s the main way economists measure how well the economy is doing. The FTA scenario is the most likely scenario following the deal agreed by Boris Johnson’s government and the EU, though the details of the trade deal would not be agreed for a while yet, so this is all still hypothetical.  However, that aside, it’s incorrect to claim the analysis said that the proposals would lead to a 6.7% drop to GDP, as Mr Umunna said. The analysis said that GDP would be up to 6.7% lower after 15 years than it would have been compared to remaining in the EU. The document said “in all scenarios the economy would be expected to grow.” It’s worth mentioning that the 6.7% figure assumed that the net migration from the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) to the UK would fall to zero—in other words the number of EU immigrants coming to the UK would be balanced by the number emigrating abroad. Other estimates of the free-trade model with a more liberal migration policy were estimated to have a lower impact on GDP.   More recently think tank UK in a Changing Europe estimated GDP per person would be between 2.3% and 7% lower under Mr Johnson’s deal than remaining in the EU after 10 years.   Mr Umunna claimed that the scale of the impact on GDP would be comparable to the financial crash. This is an unfair comparison.  Between the first quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009, GDP fell by 6%. GDP per person fell even more, by 8.5% over that period.  But the key thing is that GDP is still expected to grow in real terms under the new withdrawal agreement. It’s unfair to compare the tangible loss in incomes and earnings over a period of 15 months during the financial crisis, with a similarly sized loss of potential earnings over a period of 15 years.   For wages, the comparison is even more problematic. Weekly wages fell, in real terms (adjusting for changes in prices) by 11.2% between the high in February 2008 and the low during March 2014. This covers wages for employees in Great Britain.  So not only is the comparison between a real cut to peoples’ wages during the financial crisis and a hypothetical loss of earnings due to Brexit, the level of financial loss is fairly different. The government estimates wages to be 6.4% lower over a fifteen year period. During the financial crisis and its aftermath, wages fell by 11.2% over six years. The new withdrawal agreement is seen to be a “harder” Brexit than that negotiated under Theresa May. As such, economists estimate the impact on the economy to be greater.  UK in a Changing Europe modelled the impact of Theresa May’s deal, Boris Johnson’s deal and a no deal “WTO” Brexit.  It estimated that, after ten years, GDP per person would be around £1,500 less under May’s deal, £2,000 less under Johnson’s deal and £2,500 less under no deal, compared to staying within the EU.  Its analysis took into account two things: the expected direct impact of Brexit on trade volumes and the cost of doing trade, and the knock-on impact that trade can have on productivity (which accounted for most of the costs). As mentioned before, these estimates don’t necessarily mean that people will be worse off by £2,500 in ten years than they are now. They estimate people will be less well off by that much than if we had remained in the EU. Economic forecasts over such long periods and where the details of what might happen in the future are unknown must be taken with a large pinch of salt.   As UK in a Changing Europe says: “As we have emphasised throughout, these estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, for two reasons. “First, there is inherent uncertainty associated with forecasting the impact of economic policy choices.  “Second, there is also political uncertainty as to what those future policy choices will be, both on the part of the UK and the EU.  “Nevertheless, it should be clear that under any plausible scenario the costs associated with Brexit’s potential economic effects are much larger than the savings from reduced contributions to the EU budget.”","
 
The government estimated a free trade agreement Brexit could lead to real wages being 6.4% lower after 15 years than if the UK remained in the EU. That’s not the same as saying this form of Brexit will lead to a drop in real wages compared to now.

168,fullfact,"Tens of thousands of workers will share in a £1.8 billion pay rise under a US trade deal.
","“Tens of thousands of workers will share in a £1.8 billion pay rise under a US trade deal that is “there for the taking”, the International Trade Secretary says.” Daily Telegraph, 1 March 2020 Recently, the government published a document outlining its approach to trade negotiations with the USA. The document said that a trade deal with the US could increase UK workers’ wages by £1.8 billion after 15 years, which the Telegraph reported as saying it would benefit “tens of thousands of workers.” However, this shouldn’t be understood as suggesting that a US deal will increase wages relative to where they are now, but that they’re relative to the level expected should we sign a free trade agreement with the EU first. In 2018 the Treasury did some analysis and estimated that leaving the EU and negotiating a free-trade agreement would leave wages around 6.4% lower than they would have been had we stayed in the EU, after 15 years. (That does not necessarily mean that wages would be lower than today; they might still have grown, but by less.) The new analysis from the Department for International Trade (DIT) uses this as a starting point.  It says that, assuming the UK signs that sort of free-trade agreement with the EU, signing a free trade agreement with the US would then put wages back up by £1.8 billion or 0.2%, again after 15 years. So even if the UK signs free-trade agreements with both the EU and US, the government still expects wages to be around 6% lower after 15 years than the level they would have been expected to reach, had we stayed in the EU. Even then, there are some assumptions in the analysis that seem questionable. The £1.8 billion wage growth assumes a free-trade agreement between UK and US with zero tariffs (complete tariff liberalization) and a reduction of non-tariff measures (such as plant and animal health regulations) by 50%. This is called ‘scenario 2’ in the document. Professor of Economics at the City College of New York, Marta Bengoa, told us:  “Scenario 2 is extremely optimistic as the roadblocks to a [free trade agreement] with the US remain significant. The UK will have to choose between regulatory alignment with the European Union or the United States and that will be a key factor to determine the degree of trade liberalization between UK and US. “If UK chooses to continue/maintain regulatory coherence with the EU, then the scope of the UK-US agreement will be quite limited. “This is without factorizing the current protectionist approach of the current US administration.” In other words the analysis seems to be based on a questionable premise, in assuming that the UK can both have zero-tariff trade with the EU and with the US after signing trade deals. Professor Bengoa said scenario 1, with less extensive tariff liberalisation with the US, is “more realistic” with a positive wage effect of 0.1%. She added: “The model also assumes a fixed labor supply, no changes in demography, and no major technological changes or shocks. These assumptions are quite strict for a period of 15 years. She said the model the analysis based on is “widely used in trade policy analysis but many of the underlying assumptions are difficult to match with the reality of the always changing economic environment.” Finally, the Telegraph reported that the possible wage rise will be shared by “tens of thousands of workers.” This suggests the wage effects will be concentrated among a small group of workers, while the Department for International Trade didn’t actually model the effect on specific groups. That means, though you might expect a trade deal to benefit some people (such as those whose jobs are heavily involved in imports and exports) more than others, it’s not quite right to specify that a trade deal would benefit “tens of thousands of workers.” Spread across the whole workforce, a £1.8 billion increase amounts to around £55 per worker per year.","Government analysis shows wages could be 0.2% (£1.8 billion) higher after 15 years under a scenario where we sign a free trade deal with the USA compared to a baseline scenario where we don’t. But this baseline assumes wages will be 6.4% lower than they would have been, had we remained in the EU.

","“The UK is seeking a Canada-style deal with the EU, which Treasury analysis estimates will shrink the British economy by 4.9 per cent.” The Telegraph, 2 March 2020 Last year we saw various Liberal Democrat politicians repeating the incorrect line that Brexit would shrink the economy, citing government analysis. Now we’ve actually left the EU, it seems a similar claim is being repeated by the Daily Telegraph. This seems to refer to government analysis which estimated that a hypothetical free-trade agreement (FTA) with the EU where we maintained tariff-free access but there were still non-tariff costs (such as regulatory barriers) would cost the UK between 4.9% and 6.7% of GDP growth after 15 years.  We’ve written more about this projection, and others, here.

169,fullfact,"One estimate of the “economic cost” of Brexit, £130 billion, now exceeds what we’ve paid in to the EU over 47 years.
","Lots of Full Fact readers have asked us to check a number of posts on social media which have claimed that “the economic cost of Brexit now exceeds what we’ve net paid-in to the EU over 47 years”. While it’s difficult to put a single, definitive figure on the economic impact of Brexit, these claims don’t currently add up. They are based on figures which actually show the UK’s net contributions are higher than an estimated economic cost so far. Other reports have made a more defensible claim: that Brexit will “have soon cost” or “is set to cost” the UK more than 47 years of payments to the EU budget. But these still depend on accepting an uncertain estimate for the cost of Brexit so far, plus even more uncertain estimates of the future cost. And even then, the figure at the end of 2020 is still slightly lower. The claims are based on analysis by Bloomberg Economics which found that the “economic cost” of Brexit to the UK was £130 billion by the end of 2019. This looks at how much lower GDP is in real terms than it otherwise might have been had previous trends (from before the vote to leave the EU) continued between 2016 and 2019. This “cost”, according to the analysis, is set to rise to £200 billion by the end of 2020. To put that in context, the whole UK economy was worth about £2,144 billion—or £2.1 trillion—in 2018. Following the publication of the analysis these figures were then compared on social media (not by Bloomberg) to the UK’s total net contributions to the EU. Bloomberg Economics told us that the £200 billion figure it came up with was an estimate, as it’s impossible to be sure what the economy would have looked like if the UK had voted to remain in the EU in 2016. Many different estimates have been done of the impact of Brexit on the UK, as we’ve written about before. We haven’t looked in detail at Bloomberg Economics’ calculations, but it’s already clear that its estimates are still less than the UK’s net contributions to the EU. At the moment we only have figures on what the UK has contributed to the EU up to the end of 2018, so covering 45 years rather than 47. These have been gathered by the House of Commons Library. In that time the UK’s net contribution to the EU between 1973 and 2018 was about £216 billion in real terms (accounting for the way prices change over time and using 2019 prices). The net contribution was £156 billion in cash terms (not accounting for inflation). Both of these contribution figures are higher than the “economic cost of Brexit” estimated by Bloomberg Economics up to the end of 2019. The real terms figure of EU contributions (the more meaningful of the two) is still higher than the “cost of Brexit” estimated up to the end of 2020. If you estimate what the UK will have paid in net contributions by 2020, using the latest figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility on the financial settlement with the EU, then it comes to around £222 billion in real terms.","There’s no definitive figure for the economic impact of Brexit. The analysis this is based on estimates the UK’s GDP is £130 billion lower in 2019 than it would have been had it followed pre-EU referendum trends. Between 1973 and 2018 the UK’s net contribution to the EU was £216 billion in real terms.

170,fullfact,"A three month extension to Brexit will cost £1 billion a month.
","“They made it inevitable that the people of this country would be retained in the EU against their will for at least another three months, at a cost of another £1 billion a month.”  Boris Johnson, 28 October 2019 “It is a week since this parliament voted, yet again, to force Brussels to keep this country in the European Union for at least another three months, at a cost of £1 billion a month.” Boris Johnson, 29 October 2019 In the House of Commons this week, Boris Johnson has twice repeated his claim that extending the date of Brexit for three months would cost £1 billion a month. This is false, as we have said repeatedly. A three month extension costs the UK the same amount in EU budget payments as leaving under Boris Johnson’s own deal on 31 October would have. Mr Johnson should correct his untrue statements to the House. The claim is based on the amount that the UK pays into the EU budget. Those payments are worth roughly £1 billion a month, although this doesn’t take into account some money that the UK gets back from the EU, as BBC Reality Check has pointed out.  But under Boris Johnson’s proposed deal, the UK will pay these budget contributions even after we’ve left the EU, until the end of December 2020. This is part of the financial settlement (better known as the “divorce bill”). This is the same situation as under Theresa May’s deal—Boris Johnson’s government did not renegotiate the financial settlement. That means the budget payments made during a Brexit extension to January 2020 simply have the effect of reducing the total divorce bill upon the UK’s departure. This has already happened before: the divorce bill was estimated at around £39 billion in March 2019, but is now down to around £33 billion as a result of extending the Brexit date by six months. There is a separate decision that the government will need to make before 1 July 2020, about whether the UK wants to extend the transition period that follows Brexit beyond its current end date of December 2020. The dates of this transition period have not changed from Theresa May’s deal to Boris Johnson’s deal. If the government does decide to extend that period, and the EU agrees to the extension, that would mean that the UK would need to pay into the EU budget for a longer period. At this point the UK and EU would have to negotiate what level of budget contribution the UK would make during the extended transition. The Ministerial Code, which governs the behaviour of ministers—and which the Prime Minister himself is in charge of enforcing—says that it is “of paramount importance that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity.” The Prime Minister should uphold these principles and correct his untrue statements in the House of Commons.","No it won’t. The UK would still pay that amount if it left in October under Boris Johnson’s deal.

171,fullfact,"An extension to the date of Brexit would cost £1 billion a month.
","“I think that it would be a mistake to keep the UK bound in beyond the time that the people want to come out… at a cost of £1 billion a month.” Boris Johnson, BBC Radio 4 Today, 1 October 2019 (2 h 21 m) This morning, the Prime Minister repeated his inaccurate claim that extending the date of Brexit beyond 31 October would cost “£1 billion a month”.  This is not true. The Prime Minister says he wants to leave on 31 October with a deal. If he does, the UK will be in a transition period to the end of December 2020, during which it will pay into the EU budget anyway. So extending the date of Brexit into 2020 won’t, by itself, cost us any more in budget contributions than leaving with a deal in October this year would. Those payments just get taken off the final “divorce bill” when we leave. The government has given no indication that it plans to renegotiate either the financial settlement part of the deal—the divorce bill—or the transition period in the month remaining. That situation hasn’t changed since we first fact checked this a month ago. And if you’re not planning to renegotiate the divorce bill or the transition, then the only way you can claim extending would cost us £1 billion more is if you’re comparing it to leaving with no deal, and refusing to pay the divorce bill. The Prime Minister has said that, in the event of no deal, he does plan to not pay the financial settlement (the legal situation of that would be uncertain). But he also repeated in his Today interview that his plan is to leave with a deal. The EU has also made clear that it will make the divorce bill a condition of any future trade deal. You can see evidence that a short extension wouldn’t cost us more from the fact this has already happened once. Because the UK has stayed a full EU member longer than expected, we have paid budget contributions since 29 March. But all that means is that the divorce bill has gone down by the same amount: the original divorce bill was around £39 billion in March, but this has now gone down to £33 billion. It does not in itself make any difference to how much we pay. If the UK had a deal but extended the transition to 2021 or 2022 (which is possible under the current agreement if both sides agree, but is not something the Prime Minister has said he wants to do), then the UK would pay more, as it would continue contributing to the EU budget for those extra years. But we don’t know how much that would be, as the EU hasn’t yet set its budget for then. Mr Johnson’s government has publicly said it is committed to getting a deal with the EU, and hasn’t said it wants to renegotiate the divorce bill or the transition. That’s what makes this claim wrong. If the government publicly said its policy was to go for no deal, then it could argue that it would try to avoid paying the divorce bill. If they then succeeded in avoiding that bill, this claim might be in the right ballpark (although still not quite right, as BBC Reality Check have pointed out). But as it stands, the Prime Minister asserted two contradictory things in the same interview.

172,fullfact,"An extension to Brexit would cost the UK £1 billion a month
","“If you look at the Bill that Hilary Benn and the Jeremy Corbyn-led opposition have brought forward… It would create paralysing uncertainty, it’s craftily designed not just for one extension but to try and allow serial extensions, it would immediately require the UK to accept any EU conditions however punitive, however harsh, and regardless of those conditions the price tag for the taxpayer would be one billion pounds each month.” Dominic Raab MP, Radio 4 Today, 3 September 2019 Dominic Raab: It would cost the British taxpayer – because it’s seeking an extension – one billion pounds… Presenter: I think if we’re talking about potential elections, that costs an awful lot itself, doesn’t it? Raab: Not a billion pounds each day, for sure, which is the price tag. Dominic Raab MP, Radio 5 Live Breakfast, 3 September 2019 This morning, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab claimed that the Bill from Hilary Benn MP and others, intended to rule out a no deal Brexit unless parliament consents, would cost British taxpayers £1 billion a month (we assume Mr Raab misspoke when he said £1 billion “a day” in his Radio 5 Live interview, as that would be very wrong). It’s also been reported that the same £1 billion a month claim was made by a Number 10 spokesperson, attributing it to the UK having to pay additional EU budget contributions if our exit from the EU is delayed. This is potentially misleading, as it’s based on comparing the cost of any extension specifically to a no deal scenario in which the UK did not pay any of the “divorce bill” (the financial settlement previously agreed with the EU). But the government’s stated intent, repeated by Mr. Raab in the same interviews, is still to leave with a deal. Most studies predict that the economic effects of leaving the EU will exceed the benefits of not having to pay the EU membership fee. The “divorce bill” agreed by Theresa May’s government already includes the UK’s normal payments into the EU budget until December 2020. The legislation currently before Parliament itself proposes an extension only until January 2020 (although the EU could propose a different extension, which could itself be rejected by Parliament.) As such, any payments into the EU budget following an extension in this period would reduce the final “divorce bill” paid upon leaving the EU by the same amount. Leaving with a deal in January 2020 wouldn’t cost more in EU budget contributions than leaving with a deal in October 2019 would. This has already happened once: the original settlement was around £39 billion, but this is now down to £33 billion, largely as a result of extending Brexit from March to October this year.  The government could of course plan to try and renegotiate this financial settlement before October 31, but we aren’t aware of any indication so far that they hope to do this. In his Radio 4 interview, Mr. Raab said that the government had a “targeted ask” in negotiations, which was removing the Irish backstop. If Mr. Raab is comparing the cost of any extension to a no deal exit at the end of October, then his figure of £1 billion for monthly EU contributions is in the right ballpark. However, as BBC Reality Check has pointed out, this doesn’t factor in payments received from the EU, which would reduce the amount by about a quarter. It’s also not entirely clear that leaving with no deal would mean we could avoid paying the “divorce bill”, something which Boris Johnson has said several times would be his plan in a no deal scenario. When we looked at this question earlier this year, we found that under international law it’s not clearly set out that the UK has to pay anything once it has left the EU. However, the EU would be within its rights to take the case to the International Court of Justice on the grounds of the UK’s repeated commitments to pay, and the outcome of such a case would be hard to predict. It’s not necessarily wrong to compare the potential cost of an extension to a no deal exit - but it’s potentially misleading to do so given that in the same interview Mr Raab restated that the government’s plan is to leave with a deal (“The prime minister’s been very clear, we want a deal” he said on Radio 4). And if you were making such a comparison, you should factor in the fact that no deal exit will itself have costs.","This is only compared to a no deal exit in which the UK refuses to pay the “divorce bill”, and it doesn’t include payments back from the EU to the UK. If we leave with a deal, any extension up to the end of 2020 will not cost us extra, as the agreed financial settlement already includes these payments.

173,fullfact,"Under Boris Johnson’s planned withdrawal agreement GDP per capita would fall by up to 7% in 10 years.
","“Mr Johnson’s plan is also a much harder Brexit than Theresa May’s.” “GDP per capita would fall by up to 7% in 10 years, says the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank.” Daily Mirror, 17 October 2019 Today, the Mirror cited analysis by think tank UK in a Changing Europe, claiming it said GDP per capita would fall by 7% over 10 years under the Prime Minister’s plans for an EU withdrawal agreement. This misses crucial context, meaning it’s misleading. UK in a Changing Europe said that GDP per person would grow by 7% less under Boris Johnson’s deal after ten years compared to a scenario where the UK remains in the EU and maintains the status quo. It did not find that GDP would fall by 7% over the ten years. That could well mean that the UK economy still grows over this period, but more slowly than if we remained in the EU. This isn’t the first example of people wrongly assuming that forecasts of Brexit’s negative impact on GDP equate to a fall in GDP compared to where it is now. UK in a Changing Europe wrote: “[We do not] attempt to forecast how much the UK economy will grow over the next ten years. “Rather, we address the narrower question of the change in the UK’s income per capita if the future relationship with the EU were based on Mr Johnson’s proposals. It’s worth noting that UK in a Changing Europe modelled numerous scenarios. A 7% fall in GDP per capita is under a system where the UK has a restrictive migration policy and productivity is affected. The scenario in which GDP is least affected is where there is a liberal migration policy and productivity is not affected. This, UK in a Changing Europe estimates, would reduce GDP by 2.3% over a ten year period compared to remaining in the EU.","Incorrect. This misreports an estimate by think tank UK in a Changing Europe. It estimated that, in one scenario, GDP per capita would be 7% lower after 10 years, compared to if the UK remained in the EU—not 7% lower than it is now.

153,fullfact,"New analysis shows that the UK will be £135 billion richer with no deal.
","“New Brexit Analysis Humiliates Remainers As UK Will Be £135bn Richer With No Deal” The British Journal, 8 July 2019 An article on the website The British Journal, dated 8 July 2019, says “the latest report by the Economists for Free Trade have calculated that the opportunities from the UK going global under a “No Deal” Brexit may give the UK an extra £135 billion per year.” The article has received over 35,000 shares on Facebook (using analysis from Crowdtangle) since its publication earlier this month, but the report in question is not new—it was published two years ago. Many users may have mistaken it for genuinely breaking news though, because The British Journal originally published the article with the BBC’s old breaking news image. It has since changed this to a generic “breaking news” image. That matter aside, a wide range of other economists have criticised Economists for Free Trade’s estimate about the economic gains from a no deal Brexit. Two years ago Economists for Free Trade (EFT) claimed that the UK economy would be better off by “as much as £135 billion a year” if the UK left the EU without a deal and unilaterally eliminated all trade barriers, including tariffs on imports. Of the £135 billion, £80 billion was estimated to come from “free trade”, £40 billion from reducing regulation, £4 billion from reducing benefit payments to unskilled EU migrants, and £11 billion from no longer paying into the EU budget.   But a wide range of other economists have criticised the group’s estimates and we’ve looked at a few of their main points below. Much of the criticism of EFT’s calculation has focused on the points about “free trade”—where it identifies the bulk of the economic growth to come from. EFT’s argument is essentially that, if the UK left the EU on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms, it could remove all tariffs and non-tariff barriers on imports from anywhere in the world, which would reduce the prices paid by British consumers by 10%, which in turn would drive an upturn in the economy (GDP). The 10% figure has been criticised. Researchers at the London School of Economics (LSE) said the figure “comes from looking at the differences in price levels between the UK and some other countries and arguing that these higher prices are due to protectionism caused mainly by EU regulations (non-tariff barriers).” However, this argument ignores the possibility that prices in EU markets may be higher for other reasons, for example because EU consumers buy better quality products. The LSE continues: “say Europeans put a higher premium on high-quality clothing compared with Americans. It will look like Europeans are paying more for their clothes, but in reality, the higher average prices simply reflect a different mix of purchases.” Also the data used by the EFT comes from 2002, meaning the estimates are quite out of date. Economists have also challenged the EFT’s assumption that UK exporters would not face increased non-tariff barriers to trade with the EU if we left on WTO terms. The Institute for Government describes this assumption as “extreme”. Non-tariff barriers are things like regulatory standards which trading partners have to comply with. They can limit the amount of trade which two countries are able to do together. It is estimated that the non-tariff barriers faced by non-EU members exporting to the EU range from 7%-21% of the value of those goods (whereas members of the EU single market don’t face such barriers when trading with one another). The EFT acknowledges this, yet believes that UK exporters would not face new non-tariff barriers if the UK left the EU on WTO terms because WTO rules wouldn’t allow it.  The Institute for Government says: “WTO law is not strong enough to compel the EU to abandon the legal requirements of the Single Market”, a finding supported by trade law experts. This would mean the UK would likely face significant non-tariff barriers on exports to the EU if it adopted the policy proposed by EFT.","The analysis in question is two years old, and claims that GDP would grow by £135 billion if the UK unilaterally removed all barriers to international trade after Brexit. The analysis has been criticised by other economists, especially for its argument that the UK would not face new non-tariff barriers to trade with the EU in this scenario.

Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland and Canada have slashed tariffs—their citizens are better off as a result, and their economies have thrived.
","   The pub chain JD Wetherspoon has recently distributed beer mats in its pubs making a number of claims about the EU and outlining what Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin thinks the UK government’s Brexit policy should be. These beer mats have also been the subject of a number of news articles. We were asked by Full Fact readers to see if these claims stack up. The initial claim - that 'Free Trade' and 'No Deal' mean the same thing - is misleading. Exiting the EU without a deal wouldn't necessarily mean that the UK would adopt a particular trade policy afterwards; it would mean that the government would have the option to adopt it, within the constraints of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. There have been calls for the UK in a no-deal scenario to follow the lead of countries like Singapore to operate with few, if any, import tariffs. However, this is not currently government policy, and it's also possible that the government could choose to raise import duties following a no-deal Brexit. The UK government is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU, and the shape of the UK and the EU’s future relationship. The UK's aims include what it calls a “deep and comprehensive economic partnership”, with the EU, including establishing a “free trade area for goods”.  At the moment, the UK is part of the EU Customs Union. This means we can’t face or impose tariffs (which are like taxes) on our trade with other countries in the customs union. The EU does set some tariffs on trade that comes in from the rest of the world, outside the customs union, which means some UK imports face tariffs too. That’s unless the EU has a specific trade agreement with the countries involved. It also waives tariffs on most goods from almost 50 developing countries under its Everything But Arms policy.  If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal in place we would trade with the EU under the rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation: an international body which regulates world trade. This is what people mean by trading “under WTO terms” or a “no deal Brexit”. This means the UK could remove tariffs on some goods that currently face them via the EU. It’s generally accepted that reducing tariffs in and of itself lowers consumer prices: after all, these are an additional tax on products. There’s inherent uncertainty to any predictions, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has estimated that abolishing tariffs entirely could reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7–1.2%. But tariffs are just one factor that impacts on the prices that consumers actually pay.         Removing tariffs like this is only possible if the UK leaves the EU’s customs union. Doing this would likely lead to the need for new checks on goods moving between the UK and the EU, which would introduce new costs on this trade. The IFS concludes that these new costs would probably be greater than the limited savings from abolishing tariffs: leading to higher costs for consumers. The UK government has recently published a series of guidance notes explaining how people should prepare for a no-deal Brexit, giving some clarity as to what these “non-tariff barriers” would look like. The trade guidance it has published suggests that businesses might consider buying new software or hiring “a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider” to help them navigate these new requirements.  In a poll conducted by ICM on behalf of the Guardian in August 2017, respondents were asked whether they thought that “paying an ‘exit fee’ of up to £40bn … as the UK’s contribution to spending commitments made by the UK when the UK was a member” was acceptable or unacceptable. 75% said they thought it was unacceptable. Polling organisation YouGov has noted that people’s responses to this question seem to depend a lot on how the question is framed. Respondents tend to be more supportive of the lower figure in a range of options and less supportive of higher figures. In this case the £40 billion was the highest figure provided. The size of the UK’s “divorce bill” with the EU is estimated to be £35-39 billion. We’ve written more about that here. Dividing £39 billion by the population of the UK and the number of MPs does give you about “£600 for every man, woman and child in the UK — or £60 million per MP”. A House of Lords report has argued that legally the UK isn’t required to pay a penny. This has been disputed by some legal experts, and the report itself acknowledges that there are “competing interpretations”. The Institute for Government has suggested that, if the UK refused to pay the exit fee, the EU might seek redress through the International Court of Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The UK Government collects tariff revenues on goods it imports from states that don’t have tariff-free trade with the EU, and contributes this to the EU budget, after keeping 20% of this money to cover “collection costs”. The UK then receives a proportion of its contribution to the EU budget back in EU-funded projects in the UK (just less than half in 2017), though less than many other member countries.   This 93% figure seems to refer to the proportion of the world’s population that is in not in the EU, and is correct. Another way of considering this issue is the proportion of the world’s economic activity (measured in GDP) that is accounted for outside of the EU: an estimated 78% in 2016. Whether consumers would want to swap EU goods like champagne for English sparkling wine is a matter for them. This isn’t a straightforward claim, and there’s no definitive way of measuring the impact that tariff changes might have had on those countries’ economies. Nor is there an easy way of summarising how low a country’s tariffs are, because they can vary a lot. One way to compare what sort of tariffs different countries charge on their imports is to compare their average World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs. This isn’t a perfect measure of how “free” a country’s trade is, as it doesn’t take account of any preferential trade agreements that individual countries or groups of countries have negotiated. In the case of the EU, for example, most trade takes place with countries that have negotiated improvements on these WTO rates. It also doesn’t tell you anything about trade in services. This isn’t subject to tariffs, but can face other non-tariff barriers to cross-border trade. Countries have two sets of tariffs: “bound tariffs” and “Most Favoured Nation” (MFN) tariffs. The bound tariff is the “upper bound”: the amount that countries have pledged to the WTO that they won’t exceed. The MFN tariffs are the ones that are generally used, and must be applied to all WTO members a trade agreement isn’t in place with. In WTO parlance this means that all countries are treated the same as the “Most Favoured Nation”. There can be a large discrepancy between these two figures. Hong Kong is the only place in the world to remove all of its tariffs, and in general, agricultural goods are subject to higher tariffs than other goods. Switzerland’s average MFN tariff, for example, is increased by the high tariffs it applies to agricultural products: on average 35%. Singapore’s average MFN tariff is zero, but this hides two details. One is that it retains a small average tariff on beverages and tobacco: 1.6%. The other is that it has a much higher average “bound tariff” of 9.4%: the level that the country can raise its tariffs to without breaking WTO rules.  Both the USA and India have expressed interest in agreeing trade deals with the UK. These will be complex to negotiate and will require the UK government to make trade-offs. For example, in a trade deal with the US, how much would the UK want to coordinate the two countries' very different regulatory systems (the prospect of chlorine-washed chicken for sale in the UK is often raised as a concern by UK consumers)? And in a trade deal with India, would the UK want to ease immigration rules for Indian workers?    It is generally thought that new trade deals will take the UK several years, at the very least, to negotiate. The more these trade deals seek to do—for example, the more non-tariff barriers they seek to eliminate—the longer they will take. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact  ","
 
Uncertain. This is a very broad claim, and it is hard to attribute the performance of any economy to one factor such as reducing tariffs.

Lawyers have repeatedly said that there is no legal obligation for the UK to pay to leave the EU.
","   The pub chain JD Wetherspoon has recently distributed beer mats in its pubs making a number of claims about the EU and outlining what Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin thinks the UK government’s Brexit policy should be. These beer mats have also been the subject of a number of news articles. We were asked by Full Fact readers to see if these claims stack up. The initial claim - that 'Free Trade' and 'No Deal' mean the same thing - is misleading. Exiting the EU without a deal wouldn't necessarily mean that the UK would adopt a particular trade policy afterwards; it would mean that the government would have the option to adopt it, within the constraints of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. There have been calls for the UK in a no-deal scenario to follow the lead of countries like Singapore to operate with few, if any, import tariffs. However, this is not currently government policy, and it's also possible that the government could choose to raise import duties following a no-deal Brexit. The UK government is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU, and the shape of the UK and the EU’s future relationship. The UK's aims include what it calls a “deep and comprehensive economic partnership”, with the EU, including establishing a “free trade area for goods”.  At the moment, the UK is part of the EU Customs Union. This means we can’t face or impose tariffs (which are like taxes) on our trade with other countries in the customs union. The EU does set some tariffs on trade that comes in from the rest of the world, outside the customs union, which means some UK imports face tariffs too. That’s unless the EU has a specific trade agreement with the countries involved. It also waives tariffs on most goods from almost 50 developing countries under its Everything But Arms policy.  If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal in place we would trade with the EU under the rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation: an international body which regulates world trade. This is what people mean by trading “under WTO terms” or a “no deal Brexit”. This means the UK could remove tariffs on some goods that currently face them via the EU. It’s generally accepted that reducing tariffs in and of itself lowers consumer prices: after all, these are an additional tax on products. There’s inherent uncertainty to any predictions, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has estimated that abolishing tariffs entirely could reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7–1.2%. But tariffs are just one factor that impacts on the prices that consumers actually pay.         Removing tariffs like this is only possible if the UK leaves the EU’s customs union. Doing this would likely lead to the need for new checks on goods moving between the UK and the EU, which would introduce new costs on this trade. The IFS concludes that these new costs would probably be greater than the limited savings from abolishing tariffs: leading to higher costs for consumers. The UK government has recently published a series of guidance notes explaining how people should prepare for a no-deal Brexit, giving some clarity as to what these “non-tariff barriers” would look like. The trade guidance it has published suggests that businesses might consider buying new software or hiring “a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider” to help them navigate these new requirements.  In a poll conducted by ICM on behalf of the Guardian in August 2017, respondents were asked whether they thought that “paying an ‘exit fee’ of up to £40bn … as the UK’s contribution to spending commitments made by the UK when the UK was a member” was acceptable or unacceptable. 75% said they thought it was unacceptable. Polling organisation YouGov has noted that people’s responses to this question seem to depend a lot on how the question is framed. Respondents tend to be more supportive of the lower figure in a range of options and less supportive of higher figures. In this case the £40 billion was the highest figure provided. The size of the UK’s “divorce bill” with the EU is estimated to be £35-39 billion. We’ve written more about that here. Dividing £39 billion by the population of the UK and the number of MPs does give you about “£600 for every man, woman and child in the UK — or £60 million per MP”. A House of Lords report has argued that legally the UK isn’t required to pay a penny. This has been disputed by some legal experts, and the report itself acknowledges that there are “competing interpretations”. The Institute for Government has suggested that, if the UK refused to pay the exit fee, the EU might seek redress through the International Court of Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The UK Government collects tariff revenues on goods it imports from states that don’t have tariff-free trade with the EU, and contributes this to the EU budget, after keeping 20% of this money to cover “collection costs”. The UK then receives a proportion of its contribution to the EU budget back in EU-funded projects in the UK (just less than half in 2017), though less than many other member countries.   This 93% figure seems to refer to the proportion of the world’s population that is in not in the EU, and is correct. Another way of considering this issue is the proportion of the world’s economic activity (measured in GDP) that is accounted for outside of the EU: an estimated 78% in 2016. Whether consumers would want to swap EU goods like champagne for English sparkling wine is a matter for them. This isn’t a straightforward claim, and there’s no definitive way of measuring the impact that tariff changes might have had on those countries’ economies. Nor is there an easy way of summarising how low a country’s tariffs are, because they can vary a lot. One way to compare what sort of tariffs different countries charge on their imports is to compare their average World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs.

Correct, though not all non-EU trade is subject to tariffs. The EU has arrangements—including trade deals—with non-EU countries that reduce or remove these tariffs.

Ending tariffs means lower prices in shops and pubs.
","   The pub chain JD Wetherspoon has recently distributed beer mats in its pubs making a number of claims about the EU and outlining what Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin thinks the UK government’s Brexit policy should be. These beer mats have also been the subject of a number of news articles. We were asked by Full Fact readers to see if these claims stack up. The initial claim - that 'Free Trade' and 'No Deal' mean the same thing - is misleading. Exiting the EU without a deal wouldn't necessarily mean that the UK would adopt a particular trade policy afterwards; it would mean that the government would have the option to adopt it, within the constraints of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. There have been calls for the UK in a no-deal scenario to follow the lead of countries like Singapore to operate with few, if any, import tariffs. However, this is not currently government policy, and it's also possible that the government could choose to raise import duties following a no-deal Brexit. The UK government is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU, and the shape of the UK and the EU’s future relationship. The UK's aims include what it calls a “deep and comprehensive economic partnership”, with the EU, including establishing a “free trade area for goods”.  At the moment, the UK is part of the EU Customs Union. This means we can’t face or impose tariffs (which are like taxes) on our trade with other countries in the customs union. The EU does set some tariffs on trade that comes in from the rest of the world, outside the customs union, which means some UK imports face tariffs too. That’s unless the EU has a specific trade agreement with the countries involved. It also waives tariffs on most goods from almost 50 developing countries under its Everything But Arms policy.  If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal in place we would trade with the EU under the rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation: an international body which regulates world trade. This is what people mean by trading “under WTO terms” or a “no deal Brexit”. This means the UK could remove tariffs on some goods that currently face them via the EU. It’s generally accepted that reducing tariffs in and of itself lowers consumer prices: after all, these are an additional tax on products. There’s inherent uncertainty to any predictions, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has estimated that abolishing tariffs entirely could reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7–1.2%. But tariffs are just one factor that impacts on the prices that consumers actually pay.         Removing tariffs like this is only possible if the UK leaves the EU’s customs union. Doing this would likely lead to the need for new checks on goods moving between the UK and the EU, which would introduce new costs on this trade. The IFS concludes that these new costs would probably be greater than the limited savings from abolishing tariffs: leading to higher costs for consumers. The UK government has recently published a series of guidance notes explaining how people should prepare for a no-deal Brexit, giving some clarity as to what these “non-tariff barriers” would look like. The trade guidance it has published suggests that businesses might consider buying new software or hiring “a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider” to help them navigate these new requirements.  In a poll conducted by ICM on behalf of the Guardian in August 2017, respondents were asked whether they thought that “paying an ‘exit fee’ of up to £40bn … as the UK’s contribution to spending commitments made by the UK when the UK was a member” was acceptable or unacceptable. 75% said they thought it was unacceptable. Polling organisation YouGov has noted that people’s responses to this question seem to depend a lot on how the question is framed. Respondents tend to be more supportive of the lower figure in a range of options and less supportive of higher figures. In this case the £40 billion was the highest figure provided. The size of the UK’s “divorce bill” with the EU is estimated to be £35-39 billion. We’ve written more about that here. Dividing £39 billion by the population of the UK and the number of MPs does give you about “£600 for every man, woman and child in the UK — or £60 million per MP”. A House of Lords report has argued that legally the UK isn’t required to pay a penny. This has been disputed by some legal experts, and the report itself acknowledges that there are “competing interpretations”. The Institute for Government has suggested that, if the UK refused to pay the exit fee, the EU might seek redress through the International Court of Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The UK Government collects tariff revenues on goods it imports from states that don’t have tariff-free trade with the EU, and contributes this to the EU budget, after keeping 20% of this money to cover “collection costs”. The UK then receives a proportion of its contribution to the EU budget back in EU-funded projects in the UK (just less than half in 2017), though less than many other member countries.   This 93% figure seems to refer to the proportion of the world’s population that is in not in the EU, and is correct. Another way of considering this issue is the proportion of the world’s economic activity (measured in GDP) that is accounted for outside of the EU: an estimated 78% in 2016. Whether consumers would want to swap EU goods like champagne for English sparkling wine is a matter for them. This isn’t a straightforward claim, and there’s no definitive way of measuring the impact that tariff changes might have had on those countries’ economies. Nor is there an easy way of summarising how low a country’s tariffs are, because they can vary a lot. One way to compare what sort of tariffs different countries charge on their imports is to compare their average World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs. This isn’t a perfect measure of how “free” a country’s trade is, as it doesn’t take account of any preferential trade agreements that individual countries or groups of countries have negotiated. In the case of the EU, for example, most trade takes place with countries that have negotiated improvements on these WTO rates. It also doesn’t tell you anything about trade in services. This isn’t subject to tariffs, but can face other non-tariff barriers to cross-border trade. Countries have two sets of tariffs: “bound tariffs” and “Most Favoured Nation” (MFN) tariffs. The bound tariff is the “upper bound”: the amount that countries have pledged to the WTO that they won’t exceed. The MFN tariffs are the ones that are generally used, and must be applied to all WTO members a trade agreement isn’t in place with. In WTO parlance this means that all countries are treated the same as the “Most Favoured Nation”. There can be a large discrepancy between these two figures. Hong Kong is the only place in the world to remove all of its tariffs, and in general, agricultural goods are subject to higher tariffs than other goods. Switzerland’s average MFN tariff, for example, is increased by the high tariffs it applies to agricultural products: on average 35%. Singapore’s average MFN tariff is zero, but this hides two details. One is that it retains a small average tariff on beverages and tobacco: 1.6%. The other is that it has a much higher average “bound tariff” of 9.4%: the level that the country can raise its tariffs to without breaking WTO rules.  Both the USA and India have expressed interest in agreeing trade deals with the UK. These will be complex to negotiate and will require the UK government to make trade-offs. For example, in a trade deal with the US, how much would the UK want to coordinate the two countries' very different regulatory systems (the prospect of chlorine-washed chicken for sale in the UK is often raised as a concern by UK consumers)? And in a trade deal with India, would the UK want to ease immigration rules for Indian workers?    It is generally thought that new trade deals will take the UK several years, at the very least, to negotiate. The more these trade deals seek to do—for example, the more non-tariff barriers they seek to eliminate—the longer they will take. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact  ","
 
Not necessarily. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that a reduction in consumer prices from reducing tariffs would be wiped out by extra costs imposed by the UK leaving the EU customs union.

","   The pub chain JD Wetherspoon has recently distributed beer mats in its pubs making a number of claims about the EU and outlining what Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin thinks the UK government’s Brexit policy should be. These beer mats have also been the subject of a number of news articles. We were asked by Full Fact readers to see if these claims stack up. The initial claim - that 'Free Trade' and 'No Deal' mean the same thing - is misleading. Exiting the EU without a deal wouldn't necessarily mean that the UK would adopt a particular trade policy afterwards; it would mean that the government would have the option to adopt it, within the constraints of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. There have been calls for the UK in a no-deal scenario to follow the lead of countries like Singapore to operate with few, if any, import tariffs. However, this is not currently government policy, and it's also possible that the government could choose to raise import duties following a no-deal Brexit. The UK government is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU, and the shape of the UK and the EU’s future relationship. The UK's aims include what it calls a “deep and comprehensive economic partnership”, with the EU, including establishing a “free trade area for goods”.  At the moment, the UK is part of the EU Customs Union. This means we can’t face or impose tariffs (which are like taxes) on our trade with other countries in the customs union. The EU does set some tariffs on trade that comes in from the rest of the world, outside the customs union, which means some UK imports face tariffs too. That’s unless the EU has a specific trade agreement with the countries involved. It also waives tariffs on most goods from almost 50 developing countries under its Everything But Arms policy.  If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal in place we would trade with the EU under the rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation: an international body which regulates world trade. This is what people mean by trading “under WTO terms” or a “no deal Brexit”. This means the UK could remove tariffs on some goods that currently face them via the EU. It’s generally accepted that reducing tariffs in and of itself lowers consumer prices: after all, these are an additional tax on products. There’s inherent uncertainty to any predictions, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has estimated that abolishing tariffs entirely could reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7–1.2%. But tariffs are just one factor that impacts on the prices that consumers actually pay.         Removing tariffs like this is only possible if the UK leaves the EU’s customs union. Doing this would likely lead to the need for new checks on goods moving between the UK and the EU, which would introduce new costs on this trade. The IFS concludes that these new costs would probably be greater than the limited savings from abolishing tariffs: leading to higher costs for consumers. The UK government has recently published a series of guidance notes explaining how people should prepare for a no-deal Brexit, giving some clarity as to what these “non-tariff barriers” would look like. The trade guidance it has published suggests that businesses might consider buying new software or hiring “a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider” to help them navigate these new requirements.  In a poll conducted by ICM on behalf of the Guardian in August 2017, respondents were asked whether they thought that “paying an ‘exit fee’ of up to £40bn … as the UK’s contribution to spending commitments made by the UK when the UK was a member” was acceptable or unacceptable. 75% said they thought it was unacceptable. Polling organisation YouGov has noted that people’s responses to this question seem to depend a lot on how the question is framed. Respondents tend to be more supportive of the lower figure in a range of options and less supportive of higher figures. In this case the £40 billion was the highest figure provided. The size of the UK’s “divorce bill” with the EU is estimated to be £35-39 billion. We’ve written more about that here. Dividing £39 billion by the population of the UK and the number of MPs does give you about “£600 for every man, woman and child in the UK — or £60 million per MP”. A House of Lords report has argued that legally the UK isn’t required to pay a penny. This has been disputed by some legal experts, and the report itself acknowledges that there are “competing interpretations”. The Institute for Government has suggested that, if the UK refused to pay the exit fee, the EU might seek redress through the International Court of Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The UK Government collects tariff revenues on goods it imports from states that don’t have tariff-free trade with the EU, and contributes this to the EU budget, after keeping 20% of this money to cover “collection costs”. The UK then receives a proportion of its contribution to the EU budget back in EU-funded projects in the UK (just less than half in 2017), though less than many other member countries.   This 93% figure seems to refer to the proportion of the world’s population that is in not in the EU, and is correct. Another way of considering this issue is the proportion of the world’s economic activity (measured in GDP) that is accounted for outside of the EU: an estimated 78% in 2016. Whether consumers would want to swap EU goods like champagne for English sparkling wine is a matter for them. This isn’t a straightforward claim, and there’s no definitive way of measuring the impact that tariff changes might have had on those countries’ economies. Nor is there an easy way of summarising how low a country’s tariffs are, because they can vary a lot. One way to compare what sort of tariffs different countries charge on their imports is to compare their average World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs. This isn’t a perfect measure of how “free” a country’s trade is, as it doesn’t take account of any preferential trade agreements that individual countries or groups of countries have negotiated. In the case of the EU, for example, most trade takes place with countries that have negotiated improvements on these WTO rates. It also doesn’t tell you anything about trade in services. This isn’t subject to tariffs, but can face other non-tariff barriers to cross-border trade. Countries have two sets of tariffs: “bound tariffs” and “Most Favoured Nation” (MFN) tariffs. The bound tariff is the “upper bound”: the amount that countries have pledged to the WTO that they won’t exceed. The MFN tariffs are the ones that are generally used, and must be applied to all WTO members a trade agreement isn’t in place with. In WTO parlance this means that all countries are treated the same as the “Most Favoured Nation”. There can be a large discrepancy between these two figures. Hong Kong is the only place in the world to remove all of its tariffs, and in general, agricultural goods are subject to higher tariffs than other goods. Switzerland’s average MFN tariff, for example, is increased by the high tariffs it applies to agricultural products: on average 35%. Singapore’s average MFN tariff is zero, but this hides two details. One is that it retains a small average tariff on beverages and tobacco: 1.6%. The other is that it has a much higher average “bound tariff” of 9.4%: the level that the country can raise its tariffs to without breaking WTO rules.  Both the USA and India have expressed interest in agreeing trade deals with the UK. These will be complex to negotiate and will require the UK government to make trade-offs. For example, in a trade deal with the US, how much would the UK want to coordinate the two countries' very different regulatory systems (the prospect of chlorine-washed chicken for sale in the UK is often raised as a concern by UK consumers)? And in a trade deal with India, would the UK want to ease immigration rules for Indian workers?    It is generally thought that new trade deals will take the UK several years, at the very least, to negotiate. The more these trade deals seek to do—for example, the more non-tariff barriers they seek to eliminate—the longer they will take. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact  ","A poll found that 75% of respondents said paying an EU exit fee of up to £40 billion was unacceptable.

People pay for tariffs set by the EU every time they shop—and the government collects the money and sends it to Brussels.
","   The pub chain JD Wetherspoon has recently distributed beer mats in its pubs making a number of claims about the EU and outlining what Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin thinks the UK government’s Brexit policy should be. These beer mats have also been the subject of a number of news articles. We were asked by Full Fact readers to see if these claims stack up. The initial claim - that 'Free Trade' and 'No Deal' mean the same thing - is misleading. Exiting the EU without a deal wouldn't necessarily mean that the UK would adopt a particular trade policy afterwards; it would mean that the government would have the option to adopt it, within the constraints of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. There have been calls for the UK in a no-deal scenario to follow the lead of countries like Singapore to operate with few, if any, import tariffs. However, this is not currently government policy, and it's also possible that the government could choose to raise import duties following a no-deal Brexit. The UK government is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU, and the shape of the UK and the EU’s future relationship. The UK's aims include what it calls a “deep and comprehensive economic partnership”, with the EU, including establishing a “free trade area for goods”.  At the moment, the UK is part of the EU Customs Union. This means we can’t face or impose tariffs (which are like taxes) on our trade with other countries in the customs union. The EU does set some tariffs on trade that comes in from the rest of the world, outside the customs union, which means some UK imports face tariffs too. That’s unless the EU has a specific trade agreement with the countries involved. It also waives tariffs on most goods from almost 50 developing countries under its Everything But Arms policy.  If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal in place we would trade with the EU under the rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation: an international body which regulates world trade. This is what people mean by trading “under WTO terms” or a “no deal Brexit”. This means the UK could remove tariffs on some goods that currently face them via the EU. It’s generally accepted that reducing tariffs in and of itself lowers consumer prices: after all, these are an additional tax on products. There’s inherent uncertainty to any predictions, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has estimated that abolishing tariffs entirely could reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7–1.2%. But tariffs are just one factor that impacts on the prices that consumers actually pay.         Removing tariffs like this is only possible if the UK leaves the EU’s customs union. Doing this would likely lead to the need for new checks on goods moving between the UK and the EU, which would introduce new costs on this trade. The IFS concludes that these new costs would probably be greater than the limited savings from abolishing tariffs: leading to higher costs for consumers. The UK government has recently published a series of guidance notes explaining how people should prepare for a no-deal Brexit, giving some clarity as to what these “non-tariff barriers” would look like. The trade guidance it has published suggests that businesses might consider buying new software or hiring “a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider” to help them navigate these new requirements.  In a poll conducted by ICM on behalf of the Guardian in August 2017, respondents were asked whether they thought that “paying an ‘exit fee’ of up to £40bn … as the UK’s contribution to spending commitments made by the UK when the UK was a member” was acceptable or unacceptable. 75% said they thought it was unacceptable. Polling organisation YouGov has noted that people’s responses to this question seem to depend a lot on how the question is framed. Respondents tend to be more supportive of the lower figure in a range of options and less supportive of higher figures. In this case the £40 billion was the highest figure provided. The size of the UK’s “divorce bill” with the EU is estimated to be £35-39 billion. We’ve written more about that here. Dividing £39 billion by the population of the UK and the number of MPs does give you about “£600 for every man, woman and child in the UK — or £60 million per MP”. A House of Lords report has argued that legally the UK isn’t required to pay a penny. This has been disputed by some legal experts, and the report itself acknowledges that there are “competing interpretations”. The Institute for Government has suggested that, if the UK refused to pay the exit fee, the EU might seek redress through the International Court of Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The UK Government collects tariff revenues on goods it imports from states that don’t have tariff-free trade with the EU, and contributes this to the EU budget, after keeping 20% of this money to cover “collection costs”. The UK then receives a proportion of its contribution to the EU budget back in EU-funded projects in the UK (just less than half in 2017), though less than many other member countries.   This 93% figure seems to refer to the proportion of the world’s population that is in not in the EU, and is correct. Another way of considering this issue is the proportion of the world’s economic activity (measured in GDP) that is accounted for outside of the EU: an estimated 78% in 2016. Whether consumers would want to swap EU goods like champagne for English sparkling wine is a matter for them. This isn’t a straightforward claim, and there’s no definitive way of measuring the impact that tariff changes might have had on those countries’ economies. Nor is there an easy way of summarising how low a country’s tariffs are, because they can vary a lot. One way to compare what sort of tariffs different countries charge on their imports is to compare their average World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs. This isn’t a perfect measure of how “free” a country’s trade is, as it doesn’t take account of any preferential trade agreements that individual countries or groups of countries have negotiated. In the case of the EU, for example, most trade takes place with countries that have negotiated improvements on these WTO rates. It also doesn’t tell you anything about trade in services. This isn’t subject to tariffs, but can face other non-tariff barriers to cross-border trade. Countries have two sets of tariffs: “bound tariffs” and “Most Favoured Nation” (MFN) tariffs. The bound tariff is the “upper bound”: the amount that countries have pledged to the WTO that they won’t exceed. The MFN tariffs are the ones that are generally used, and must be applied to all WTO members a trade agreement isn’t in place with. In WTO parlance this means that all countries are treated the same as the “Most Favoured Nation”. There can be a large discrepancy between these two figures. Hong Kong is the only place in the world to remove all of its tariffs, and in general, agricultural goods are subject to higher tariffs than other goods. Switzerland’s average MFN tariff, for example, is increased by the high tariffs it applies to agricultural products: on average 35%. Singapore’s average MFN tariff is zero, but this hides two details. One is that it retains a small average tariff on beverages and tobacco: 1.6%. The other is that it has a much higher average “bound tariff” of 9.4%: the level that the country can raise its tariffs to without breaking WTO rules.  Both the USA and India have expressed interest in agreeing trade deals with the UK. These will be complex to negotiate and will require the UK government to make trade-offs. For example, in a trade deal with the US, how much would the UK want to coordinate the two countries' very different regulatory systems (the prospect of chlorine-washed chicken for sale in the UK is often raised as a concern by UK consumers)? And in a trade deal with India, would the UK want to ease immigration rules for Indian workers?    It is generally thought that new trade deals will take the UK several years, at the very least, to negotiate. The more these trade deals seek to do—for example, the more non-tariff barriers they seek to eliminate—the longer they will take. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact  ","
 
Correct. A proportion of this money is then spent in the UK on EU-funded projects, though less than most other EU countries.

175,fullfact,"The prime minister’s Chequers deal is more unpopular than the Poll Tax.
"," “The Chequers deal is now more unpopular with the British people than the Poll Tax was.” Justine Greening MP, 3 September 2018 “The Prime Minister’s Chequers plan is even more unpopular than the Poll Tax.” Ian Blackford MP, 5 September 2018 In recent days politicians from several parties have said that the so-called ‘Chequers deal’—the current cabinet-endorsed negotiating position on Brexit—is less popular than the ‘Poll Tax’, the widely-protested tax introduced by Margaret Thatcher’s government. It’s true that, according to recent polls, the percentage of people who say they support the Chequers deal (18%) is lower than the percentage who supported the Poll Tax at its least popular (19%), although based on a poll that’s such a small difference we can’t know for sure that Chequers has smaller support levels. The most common way of measuring popularity, however, is to look at the difference between positive and negative opinions. By this measure, the Poll Tax (with a net approval of -57% at its least popular) was far more unpopular than the Chequers deal (net approval -34%), as many more people actively opposed it. A large percentage of people say they don’t know what they think of the Chequers deal. The ‘Poll Tax’ – officially known as the ‘Community Charge’ – was a new local government flat tax introduced by Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government, to replace the previous system of council ‘rates’. It came into force in Scotland at the beginning of the 1989 financial year, and then in England and Wales a year later in 1990. The tax was extremely unpopular, sparking widespread protests, riots and co-ordinated non-payment campaigns. Opposition to the tax (and the damage it was having on Conservative polling figures) was a major factor the leadership challenge that forced Margaret Thatcher to resign in November 1990. Polling firm Ipsos MORI has historical opinion poll figures covering several years from when the Poll Tax was first proposed, until its introduction in England and Wales in the spring of 1990. This data shows that opposition to the tax peaked in March 1990, shortly before it was due to come into force in England and Wales, when only 19% of people approved of it and 76% disapproved, a net approval of -57%. The ‘Chequers deal’ or ‘Chequers plan’ is the common term for the Brexit negotiating position agreed by the cabinet during a meeting at Chequers (the prime minister’s country residence) in early July. It was immediately controversial, and prompted the resignation of several pro-Brexit cabinet ministers who opposed it, including the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. A poll by Sky Data on September 4 found that 18% of people approved of the deal, while 52% disapproved (with 30% responding ‘don’t know’). Earlier polling by YouGov, which asked a slightly different question, showed that only 13% of people thought the deal would be “good for Britain” compared to 42% who thought it would “not be good for Britain” (44% responded ‘don’t know’). Here we’ll use the Sky Data figures, both because they are the most recent, and because the question they asked is most comparable to that asked about the Poll Tax. While the level of support for the Chequers deal is marginally below that of the Poll Tax (although within the polling margin of error), the level of opposition to it is significantly lower, by 24%. This is reflected in the fact that the percentage of ‘don’t knows’ is far higher for the Chequers deal, at 30% compared to just 5% for the Poll Tax. This means that the net approval for the Poll Tax at its worst was -57%, while that for the Chequers Deal is -34%. Over the years that Ipsos MORI polled, the Poll Tax regularly had net approval ratings below the current level for the Chequers deal. So while the low level of support for the Chequers deal is comparable to the Poll Tax at its least popular, it’s not accurate to say that it is “more unpopular”. When considering the number of ‘don’t know’ responses, it’s worth noting that with the Poll Tax the proportion of ‘don’t knows’ decreased as the policy came closer to being implemented. It’s also worth noting that people can dislike the Chequers deal for opposing reasons: some Leave supporters think the form of Brexit it proposes is too ‘soft’, while Remain supporters may oppose it because it is still a plan for Brexit.","Not quite. Recent polling suggests that the Chequers deal is supported by fewer people than the Poll Tax was at its least popular, but fewer people also oppose it outright.

Sir John Curtice has said there is absolutely no evidence of a swing in favour of a second referendum.
","“Public opinion is clearly swinging in favour of having a people's vote.” Vince Cable, September 20 2018 “There isn’t any evidence for that… Sir John Curtice, who’s like Britain’s leading pollster,  today said there is absolutely no evidence of a swing in favour of a second referendum.” Camilla Tominey, September 20 2018 There is some evidence that public opinion has swung towards a referendum on the final Brexit deal, although there is significant disagreement between polls. It’s not right to claim that Sir John Curtice has said there’s ""absolutely no evidence"" for it - he has said the evidence is not ""consistent"". This means it is still not entirely clear what the trend is, and whether a majority of the public back a second vote. As Professor Curtice has said, the uncertainty comes from the fact that polling responses can differ significantly depending on exactly what question is asked, and what the options for a hypothetical referendum would be. Professor Sir John Curtice is a political scientist at Strathclyde University and the National Centre for Social Research, and is widely regarded as one of the UK’s leading authorities on polling (and who has become well-known thanks to his regular appearances on the BBC). We haven’t been able to find any recent comments from him that suggest “there is absolutely no evidence of a swing in favour of a second referendum”. He did tell the BBC on September 20 that “there is no consistent evidence of a shift in support for a second referendum"" - which isn’t quite the same.  ""There is no consistent evidence of a shift in support for a second referendum"" Prof John Curtice told #factcheckjoel after #politicslive guests made claims about calls for a further votehttps://t.co/iR09IQOEQt #politicslive pic.twitter.com/8DJfXbcbBY He has also repeatedly written in the past month that there is some evidence for such a swing. However, he has cautioned that different polls give very different results, and that it is unclear whether a majority of the public currently support it - hence his comment that the evidence isn't consistent. On August 28, he wrote for the What UK Thinks: EU site that “while there is some evidence that Chequers may have persuaded a few more voters of the merits of holding another ballot, we probably need more instances of the same question showing an increase in support since before the beginning of July before we can be sure that this is indeed what has happened.” Some weeks later on September 18, he wrote for the BBC: “This idea [a referendum on the final deal] has gradually become more popular - even more so in the wake of the Chequers agreement. But there may still not be a majority in favour.” And the following day he tweeted that some polls show a shift towards a second vote, but others do not:  Is support for holding #euref2 increasing as claimed today by @peoplesvote_uk? Some polls say yes - but others don't. https://t.co/jjpnWjT67E; https://t.co/pjipNWSbAh; https://t.co/dcfRycXgC6 & https://t.co/wHWH2q2y1w Public opinion over whether a second vote should be held the final deal agreed for exiting the EU is complicated by two main factors. One is how the opinion poll phrases the question, and the other is what options the hypothetical referendum would present to the voters. As Professor Curtice wrote in his August 28 post, people’s responses seem to differ depending on whether they are asked about a “second referendum”, or whether they are asked if “the public” should have a vote on the “deal”. And because different polling companies have asked different questions at different times, it is hard to say with certainty how public opinion has shifted. Polls that mention “the public” having a vote on the “deal” (such as these from Opinium and these from BMG Research) have generally been more likely to show a majority in support of the vote. Polls that use the phrase “second referendum” (such as this, also from Opinium) have generally been more likely to show a majority opposed to the vote. The other issue is that there is no consensus on what options would be included in such a referendum. It could be a two-way choice between the final deal and remaining in the EU; a two-way choice between the final deal and leaving with no deal; or a three-way choice between the final deal, no deal, or remaining. As Professor Curtice says, Remain supporters are (probably unsurprisingly) more likely to back a choice between the final deal and remaining, while Leave supporters are more likely to back a choice between the final deal and no deal. One polling company, YouGov, has consistently asked the same question at regular intervals over the past year, which gives us the best opportunity to see if there is a long-term trend. Their question is “Once the Brexit negotiations are complete and the terms of Britain's exit from the EU have been agreed, do you think there should or should not be a referendum to accept or reject them?”. The polling since April 2017 suggests that there has been a shift in favour of a second referendum - from a clear majority against a second vote a year ago, to a roughly even split in recent polls.This has to be interpreted in light of the caveats mentioned above: the phrasing of the YouGov question has generally prompted responses more opposed to a second referendum than other polling, and it still doesn’t show a clear majority in favour. Conversely, some polls that have generally shown a majority in favour of a public vote on the deal have shown a slight move in the other direction, although they still show clear majorities supporting a referendum. The only other regular poll we’re aware of that consistently showed a majority opposed to a second referendum, from Opinium, has not polled on that question since the Chequers meeting that agreed the government’s negotiating position. On the balance of the evidence, it does seem more likely than not that there has been some shift of public opinion in favour of a referendum on the final deal - but it is not consistent across different polls, depends heavily on how the question is phrased, and it’s hard to say how large the shift (if any) has been.","
 
Not quite right - Professor Curtice has said that there is some evidence of a swing, but that the evidence is not consistent.

127,fullfact,"Public opinion is swinging in favour of having a second referendum on Brexit.
","“Public opinion is clearly swinging in favour of having a people's vote.” Vince Cable, September 20 2018 “There isn’t any evidence for that… Sir John Curtice, who’s like Britain’s leading pollster,  today said there is absolutely no evidence of a swing in favour of a second referendum.” Camilla Tominey, September 20 2018 There is some evidence that public opinion has swung towards a referendum on the final Brexit deal, although there is significant disagreement between polls. It’s not right to claim that Sir John Curtice has said there’s ""absolutely no evidence"" for it - he has said the evidence is not ""consistent"". This means it is still not entirely clear what the trend is, and whether a majority of the public back a second vote. As Professor Curtice has said, the uncertainty comes from the fact that polling responses can differ significantly depending on exactly what question is asked, and what the options for a hypothetical referendum would be. Professor Sir John Curtice is a political scientist at Strathclyde University and the National Centre for Social Research, and is widely regarded as one of the UK’s leading authorities on polling (and who has become well-known thanks to his regular appearances on the BBC). We haven’t been able to find any recent comments from him that suggest “there is absolutely no evidence of a swing in favour of a second referendum”. He did tell the BBC on September 20 that “there is no consistent evidence of a shift in support for a second referendum"" - which isn’t quite the same.  ""There is no consistent evidence of a shift in support for a second referendum"" Prof John Curtice told #factcheckjoel after #politicslive guests made claims about calls for a further votehttps://t.co/iR09IQOEQt #politicslive pic.twitter.com/8DJfXbcbBY He has also repeatedly written in the past month that there is some evidence for such a swing. However, he has cautioned that different polls give very different results, and that it is unclear whether a majority of the public currently support it - hence his comment that the evidence isn't consistent. On August 28, he wrote for the What UK Thinks: EU site that “while there is some evidence that Chequers may have persuaded a few more voters of the merits of holding another ballot, we probably need more instances of the same question showing an increase in support since before the beginning of July before we can be sure that this is indeed what has happened.” Some weeks later on September 18, he wrote for the BBC: “This idea [a referendum on the final deal] has gradually become more popular - even more so in the wake of the Chequers agreement. But there may still not be a majority in favour.” And the following day he tweeted that some polls show a shift towards a second vote, but others do not:  Is support for holding #euref2 increasing as claimed today by @peoplesvote_uk? Some polls say yes - but others don't. https://t.co/jjpnWjT67E; https://t.co/pjipNWSbAh; https://t.co/dcfRycXgC6 & https://t.co/wHWH2q2y1w Public opinion over whether a second vote should be held the final deal agreed for exiting the EU is complicated by two main factors. One is how the opinion poll phrases the question, and the other is what options the hypothetical referendum would present to the voters. As Professor Curtice wrote in his August 28 post, people’s responses seem to differ depending on whether they are asked about a “second referendum”, or whether they are asked if “the public” should have a vote on the “deal”. And because different polling companies have asked different questions at different times, it is hard to say with certainty how public opinion has shifted.

128,fullfact,"Leave campaigners before the referendum weren’t consistent on whether Brexit meant leaving the customs union.
","“Nigel Farage said yesterday that when the question was put at the referendum, it was made clear that it meant leaving the single market and leaving the customs union … And we’ve checked this today and it seems that the Prime Minister did say that.” David Dimbleby, 18 October 2018 “No, he’s [Nigel Farage] wrong about that … I think that we all have to accept that lots of things were said in the referendum that should not have been said on both sides. And it wasn’t the consistent message of those that were leaving that we would leave the customs union.” Sir Keir Starmer, 18 October 2018 Key figures from both the Remain and Leave campaigns said before the referendum that voting to leave meant leaving the single market. The customs union itself was rarely mentioned before the referendum, as far as we’ve seen. There are some cases where Leave campaigners appeared to suggest the UK could stay in the single market after a vote to leave, although these examples aren’t all necessarily as straightforward as they look. In any case, they are rare exceptions, rather than the rule. It’s easy to see how the debate around this issue would have been confusing to many people, however. For one thing, there were multiple campaigns that did not necessarily have consistent positions. Also, the terminology used arguably invites misunderstanding. Campaigners often distinguished between maintaining “access to” the single market and being “full members”—a distinction with an unclear meaning that would be easy to miss, or misconstrue. The EU’s customs union is a free trade area in which countries can’t put tariffs on imports from each other, and set the same tariffs and rules for countries outside the union. The single market is more wide-ranging: member countries sign up to the free movement of goods, services, people and money across their borders. All EU members are part of both, some countries outside the EU are members of one or the other. Some countries are in a customs union with the EU but not the single market, like Turkey. Other countries are in the single market but not the customs union, like Norway. Mr Starmer’s office pointed us to a list on Vote Leave’s website of what the campaign considered “key speeches, interviews and op-eds” and pointed out the customs union was hardly mentioned in any of them. This is correct. Several of the speeches made arguments against the single market, but one of the only references to a customs union was by businessman John Longworth, who said in a speech: “That’s the reality of what the Single Market is, it’s a protectionist customs union backed by the Brussels regulation machine, and we are better off out of it, trading freely with the world, including our European neighbours, under our own laws.” Labour’s argument that the messaging on the customs union was inconsistent also rests on a speech by prominent Leave campaigner Michael Gove, in which he said: “There is a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Turkey that all European nations have access to, regardless of whether they are in or out of the euro or EU. After we vote to leave we will remain in this zone. “The suggestion that Bosnia, Serbia, Albania and the Ukraine would stay part of this free trade area - and Britain would be on the outside with just Belarus - is as credible as Jean-Claude Juncker joining UKIP. “Agreeing to maintain this continental free trade zone is the simple course and emphatically in everyone’s interests.” Turkey is in a partial customs union with the EU, but none of the other countries mentioned by Mr Gove are. He appears to be referring to a number of European countries which have some level of trading arrangements with the EU, without being customs union members, as examples of a possible post-Brexit situation for the UK. As far as we’ve seen, Leave campaigners hardly mentioned the customs union in explicit terms at all, so there was generally little clarity about what leaving might mean in that regard. Campaigners did often say the UK should be able to set its own trade policy, and this could imply leaving the customs union as well. Being part of a customs union can restrict a country’s ability to form an independent trade policy. At the same time, though, certain sectors of an economy can be left out of a customs agreement, so it’s not a straightforward in or out issue. References to the single market and the UK’s broad trading relationship with the EU after Brexit are much more common. A fortnight before the referendum in 2016, then Prime Minister David Cameron (who was campaigning for Remain) said during an interview: “The British public would be voting if we leave would be to leave the EU and leave the single market. We’d then have to negotiate a trade deal from outside with the European Union...  But if we leave the EU and the German finance minister was very clear, you’re either in or you’re out, leaving the single market, you’ve then got to negotiate a trade deal.” Key Leave figures made similar points. Michael Gove was asked by the BBC’s Andrew Marr “Do you want us to say inside the single market?” to which he responded: “No. We should be outside the single market. We should have access to the single market, but we should not be governed by the rules that the European Court of Justice imposes on us, which cost business and restrict freedom.” Fellow Leave campaigner Boris Johnson later said he agreed with Mr Gove’s comments that the UK would be out of the single market following a Brexit vote. It is unclear what was meant by having “access” to the single market. The government’s leaflet supporting Remain during the referendum said leaving meant there was a risk the UK could lose “full access” to the single market, but didn’t rule it out. It highlighted that, in terms of striking a trade deal if we left the EU, “no other country has managed to secure significant access to the Single Market” without significant trade-offs, including having to “follow EU rules over which they have no real say, pay into the EU, (and) accept EU citizens living and working in their country. But given the sheer volume of debate around the EU referendum, it’s unsurprising that there were times when claims about our possible future relationship to the single market became unclear. Some people have pointed out cases where other Leave campaigners appeared to suggest the UK should stay in the single market. For example, Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said during an interview in 2015 that: ""To repeat, absolutely nobody is talking about threatening our place in the single market"".   That is a different stance compared to the main claims of Leave campaigners, and Mr Hannan’s wording isn’t consistent across the interview itself either. Earlier on, he said ""absolutely nobody is suggesting we would give up our position in the free market in Europe"". Again, because of this loose use of terminology, it’s easy to see why people would have taken different messages away after seeing this interview. On one reading, this is another case of talking about having a continued trading relationship with the EU after Brexit, as distinct from being a member of the single market. There are also examples of leave campaigners claiming the UK could adopt a position similar to Norway—which is still part of the single market while not being an EU member. Arron Banks, a founder of the Leave.EU campaign tweeted in November 2015 “Increasingly the Norway option looks the best for the UK”. It’s fair to say that these examples are the exception rather than the rule when it comes to claims about the single market, but it makes the case again that the discussion before the referendum wasn’t entirely consistent on the kind of relationship the UK could have with the EU after leaving.","The customs union was rarely mentioned by Leave campaigners before the referendum. There were generally calls for the UK to have an independent trade policy, though messages about specific trading arrangements weren’t always consistent.

129,fullfact,"70% of Conservative constituencies and 60% of Labour constituencies voted to Leave in the EU referendum.
","""7 out of 10 Conservative MPs... represent constituencies that voted to leave, as did mine. 6 out of 10 Barry’s party [Labour] represent Leave constituencies."" Claire Perry MP, 12 July 2018 The results of the EU referendum weren’t counted by parliamentary constituency, so we don’t know for sure how constituencies voted. A small number of councils did release official breakdowns by parliamentary seat, and data on some other areas was obtained by the BBC via Freedom of Information requests. The best figures we have for other constituencies comes from Professor Chris Hanretty, a political scientist at Royal Holloway University, who combined official results and the BBC data with statistical methods in order to estimate the proportion of Leave and Remain voters in every seat in England, Scotland and Wales. These estimates show that while the national result of the referendum was relatively close, with 52% voting Leave and 48% voting Remain, a much larger majority of parliamentary seats voted to Leave – with 64% of seats in Great Britain voting Leave. (This is likely due to the uneven distribution of Remain voters, who tended to cluster in large cities, while Leave voters were more evenly spread.) According to these estimates, around 75% of constituencies that were won by the Conservatives in the 2017 general election voted to Leave, while around 61% of Labour constituencies voted to Leave. All seats won by the Scottish National Party and the Green Party, and a majority of the seats won by the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, voted to Remain. These estimates are most likely the ones being referred to when politicians discuss how constituencies voted. But other than the seats where the actual result is known for sure (only 20% of constituencies) they are just estimates. As Professor Hanretty wrote when he released his work, “I’d like you to say ‘probably’ before you talk about how a constituency voted, unless I’ve flagged up a result as being known exactly.” The margin of error for the estimates is not known, due to the nature of the statistical methods used. This means that for constituencies in which the exact results are unknown, and which the estimates suggest the result of the referendum vote was close, we can’t be certain about saying whether the constituency voted Leave or Remain. Looking just at seats held by the Conservatives and Labour, if we highlight seats where the estimated referendum vote was within the 47% to 53% range and the actual result isn’t known, we can see that there are a large number of seats where the referendum vote is still uncertain.When you factor in this uncertainty, the figures for how each party’s seats voted changes a bit. By this count, 62% of Conservative seats voted Leave, with 21% uncertain and 17% Remain. Labour’s seats, meanwhile, voted 56% Leave, 8% uncertain, and 36% Remain.Of course, this depends on how wide a range of estimates you choose to classify as being “uncertain”. In doing these calculations for results in the 47% to 53% range, we deliberately opted for a relatively cautious approach, informed by the observable errors in Professor Hanretty’s estimates when compared with known results – where the average error was 1.7% and only 16 out of 128 seats had an error greater than 3%. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","These figures are roughly correct, although we don’t know for sure how many parliamentary seats voted – all we have are estimates.

176,fullfact,"73% of people under 24 voted to remain.
","“The statistics from the polls that were done showed, [...] 73% of people under 24 voted to remain.” David Dimbleby, 22 March 2017 “From what polls? The same polls that said that... Remain was going to win, and the same polls that said that the Conservatives were going to win a majority in the last general election?” BBC Question Time audience member, 22 March 2017 It’s impossible to be precise about exactly what proportion of under 25s across the UK voted Remain or Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. However, 73% seems a reasonable estimate, based on the results of a number of polls that have been done.   Because age isn’t recorded on ballot papers, we have no official figures on voting by age group, and so polling and survey data is the best source we have. These polls generally agree that around 70-75% of voters under 25s voted Remain. Pollsters Ipsos-Mori put the figure at 75%, and YouGov put the figure at 71%. These polls were  weighted after the vote to mirror the actual 48% to 52% split between Remain and Leave voters. This means they’re likely to more reliably depict the vote split by age, than pre-referendum polls that didn’t do this weighting. A poll by Lord Ashcroft, cited on last night’s Question Time, put the figure for the under-25 Remain vote at 73%, and also showed the overall split at 48% to 52%. But it doesn’t detail whether the data was similarly weighted to reflect the referendum result. We’ve asked for more information on the poll. While most polls incorrectly forecast a victory for Remain (and based on polling results experts thought it likely that there would be  a Conservative majority at the 2017 election), these polls weren’t weighted after the fact. Therefore they’re less likely to be reliable in estimating voting patterns. Following the referendum, the long-term British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey estimated that 72% of 18-24 year old voters, voted Remain. While the BSA survey interviewed far fewer people than the referendum polls, the survey’s methodology makes it one of the best available sources. Professor John Curtice, President of the British Polling Council, says that survey like this one “are more successful in making contact with those who have little interest in politics.” This means they may reach a more representative sample of people than other polls. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","That’s a reasonable estimate for how many 18-24 year old voters voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, based on the results of polls and surveys.

130,fullfact,"The EU referendum was “advisory” only.
","""The [EU] referendum was an advisory referendum” Dominic Grieve MP, 10 October 2016 “This was not an advisory referendum” John Redwood MP, 7 November 2016 Given that the meaning of the French Revolution is still contested, it’s no surprise that there are arguments over June’s EU referendum. The word “advisory” crops up a lot in the debate at the moment. Here we’ll look what people mean when they say that the referendum was, or wasn’t, advisory. The referendum was not legally binding. There’s no one source that can prove this statement true (although here’s a respectable one). That follows from the fact that the European Union Referendum Act 2015 didn’t say anything about implementing the result of the vote. It just provided that there should be one. In other countries, referendums are often legally binding—for example, because the vote is on whether to amend the constitution. The UK, famously, doesn’t have a codified constitution. A UK referendum will only have the force of law if the Act setting it up says so. In practical terms this would mean someone would be able to go to court to make the government implement the result. The Alternative Vote referendum in 2011, for example, was legally binding in this way. Otherwise, as the High Court put it on 3 November: “a referendum on any topic can only be advisory for the lawmakers in Parliament”. So, purely as a matter of law, neither the government nor Parliament has to do anything about the referendum. Some people who oppose Brexit take the argument a step further. We see images like this one on social media, highlighting the non-binding nature of the vote: “Which bits of this [briefing] are MPs now acting as if they either did not read or did not understand?” asks the philosopher AC Grayling. This is where the argument slides from legal into political. Former diplomat Brian Barder says that: “members of parliament owe the electorate their own best judgement of the national interest—taking into account the referendum result—not their obedience to the opinions of a narrow majority in a referendum or otherwise”. The argument goes that, the referendum being “advisory” and Brexit being bad, MPs should refuse to follow the result. Some MPs agree. But some people who support leaving the EU say there’s plenty of evidence that the referendum was politically binding. They say that the referendum process sent clear instructions to MPs that they should support the decision made by a majority of voters—even if the formalities don’t require them to. They point to the fact that, during one of the debates on the referendum bill on 9 June 2015, the then Foreign Secretary said “decision about our membership should be taken by the British people, not by Whitehall bureaucrats, certainly not by Brussels Eurocrats; not even by Government Ministers or parliamentarians in this Chamber”. Similarly, the government’s leaflet to all households advocating a Remain vote told voters that it would implement the result. This promise, too, does the rounds on social media. Leaflets are not law, and the High Court has since told the government that it can’t keep this promise without the approval of Parliament. But that doesn’t stop anyone from making the case that MPs delegated the Brexit decision to the voters, and have no right to unmake it now. In the end, the argument comes down to different visions for democracy in the United Kingdom. The conventional view is that ultimate political power lies with Parliament. The High Court came to its conclusion that the referendum was not legally binding guided by “basic constitutional principles of parliamentary sovereignty and representative parliamentary democracy”. In a parliamentary democracy, as barrister Rupert Myers bluntly puts it, “the people are not sovereign”. That’s why Nigel Farage, for example, accepts that the referendum result was technically advisory only, but says that “I would now wish to see constitutional change to make referendums binding”.","The referendum wasn’t legally binding, but there’s plenty of scope for argument about whether politicians should feel obliged to implement the result anyway.

177,fullfact,"Polling figures show that Theresa May’s Brexit approach is ‘pissing off most of the nation’.
","This week Leave.eu, an organisation campaigning for Brexit, circulated figures about public sentiment towards the Chequers deal and the Government’s approach to Brexit negotiations. But these figures don’t refer to the survey’s results from general public as a whole – they are for Leave voters only. When you look at all adults across England, Scotland and Wales, according to the survey it’s still the case that more people are dissatisfied with the government’s Chequers deal than satisfied, but to a lesser extent.  Leave voters are about as dissatisfied with the government’s general negotiating approach as the general population.   The data comes from a YouGov/Times survey of a representative group of British adults on the ongoing Brexit negotiations—specifically the so-called “Chequers deal”. It found that more people are not in favour of the deal than in favour of the deal. It also found that 40% of adults in Great Britain thought the deal was too soft, 12% thought it was too hard, 13% thought the balance was right, and the remaining 35% answered “none of these” or “don’t know”.  The data in the claim which showed a majority opposing the deal looked only at the results of the people surveyed who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum. The post referred to Theresa May “pissing off most of the nation”. While it’s true that leave voters were “most” of the people who voted in the 2016 referendum, Leave voters are not “most of the nation”. In mid-2016 there were an estimated 52 million adults in the UK, of whom 17 million (34%) voted leave. So it’s inaccurate to use figures for Leave voters only to describe “most of the nation”. Leave voters are more negative about the deal than the population as a whole, and according to this survey, a majority of them (54%) would be unhappy if the Chequers deal went ahead. They’re also less likely to think the deal hit the right balance between “soft” and “hard” Brexit. Nevertheless across the population far more people appear to be unhappy   with the Chequers deal than are happy with it (no matter which way the voted in the referendum). And a large majority of those surveyed (75%) think that the government is handling Brexit negotiations either “fairly badly” or “very badly”.  As with all surveys, there is a margin of error with the data. YouGov designed the survey, to ensure the views of the people it surveyed represent the views of the public, through sampling and weighting. However there are some factors that it’s still worth bearing in mind.   This survey only covers adults in Great Britain. So the people of Northern Ireland are not represented. Northern Ireland as a whole voted for Remain (unlike Great Britain) and issues around the Irish border may mean that Northern Irish people view the Chequers deal and ongoing negotiations in a different way from the rest of the UK. Therefore excluding their views on the deal and negotiations may skew the results of the data overall. Also, there are fewer non-voters included in the survey than in the general population, it counts around 1,420 voters out of the total sample of 1,730— a turnout of 82% among all adults in Great Britain. The turnout among registered voters on the day of the EU referendum was only 72% among registered voters. Non-voters surveyed were more likely to answer “don’t know” to the survey questions. So under-representing their views may also have skewed the results away from the “don’t know” responses. YouGov told us it deliberately doesn’t include as many non-voters as were observed in the referendum for two reasons. Firstly, it expects that some of the 1,420 people saying in the survey they voted Remain or Leave, did not in fact vote. Secondly it questioned the 72% turnout figure saying incompleteness, inaccuracy and double-registration in the register mean that the turnout could have in fact been higher than 72%. Though it did say this could have improved following the move from household electoral registration to individual electoral registration in 2014. The Electoral Commission said that individual registration has improved the situation, there is the potential for further improvements to remedy these issues.  Thirdly, it said that polls struggle to contact the most politically disengaged people, and so weighting up the share of non-voters could also skew the figures by overemphasising the views of “engaged non-voters”. “Unengaged non-voters” may have different views that haven’t been captured.","The numbers in the graphic refer to opinion among Leave voters only, not the public as a whole. Opinion of the progress of Brexit varies depending on what question is asked.

49% think Theresa May should stand down.
","This week Leave.eu, an organisation campaigning for Brexit, circulated figures about public sentiment towards the Chequers deal and the Government’s approach to Brexit negotiations. But these figures don’t refer to the survey’s results from general public as a whole – they are for Leave voters only.

It found that more people are not in favour of the deal than in favour of the deal. It also found that 40% of adults in Great Britain thought the deal was too soft, 12% thought it was too hard, 13% thought the balance was right, and the remaining 35% answered “none of these” or “don’t know”.

58% think the Chequers deal disrespects the result of the referendum.
","This week Leave.eu, an organisation campaigning for Brexit, circulated figures about public sentiment towards the Chequers deal and the Government’s approach to Brexit negotiations. But these figures don’t refer to the survey’s results from general public as a whole – they are for Leave voters only. When you look at all adults across England, Scotland and Wales, according to the survey it’s still the case that more people are dissatisfied with the government’s Chequers deal than satisfied, but to a lesser extent.  Leave voters are about as dissatisfied with the government’s general negotiating approach as the general population.   The data comes from a YouGov/Times survey of a representative group of British adults on the ongoing Brexit negotiations—specifically the so-called “Chequers deal”. It found that more people are not in favour of the deal than in favour of the deal. It also found that 40% of adults in Great Britain thought the deal was too soft, 12% thought it was too hard, 13% thought the balance was right, and the remaining 35% answered “none of these” or “don’t know”.  The data in the claim which showed a majority opposing the deal looked only at the results of the people surveyed who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum. The post referred to Theresa May “pissing off most of the nation”. While it’s true that leave voters were “most” of the people who voted in the 2016 referendum, Leave voters are not “most of the nation”. In mid-2016 there were an estimated 52 million adults in the UK, of whom 17 million (34%) voted leave. So it’s inaccurate to use figures for Leave voters only to describe “most of the nation”. Leave voters are more negative about the deal than the population as a whole, and according to this survey, a majority of them (54%) would be unhappy if the Chequers deal went ahead. They’re also less likely to think the deal hit the right balance between “soft” and “hard” Brexit. Nevertheless across the population far more people appear to be unhappy   with the Chequers deal than are happy with it (no matter which way the voted in the referendum). And a large majority of those surveyed (75%) think that the government is handling Brexit negotiations either “fairly badly” or “very badly”.  As with all surveys, there is a margin of error with the data. YouGov designed the survey, to ensure the views of the people it surveyed represent the views of the public, through sampling and weighting. However there are some factors that it’s still worth bearing in mind.   This survey only covers adults in Great Britain. So the people of Northern Ireland are not represented. Northern Ireland as a whole voted for Remain (unlike Great Britain) and issues around the Irish border may mean that Northern Irish people view the Chequers deal and ongoing negotiations in a different way from the rest of the UK. Therefore excluding their views on the deal and negotiations may skew the results of the data overall. Also, there are fewer non-voters included in the survey than in the general population, it counts around 1,420 voters out of the total sample of 1,730— a turnout of 82% among all adults in Great Britain. The turnout among registered voters on the day of the EU referendum was only 72% among registered voters. Non-voters surveyed were more likely to answer “don’t know” to the survey questions. So under-representing their views may also have skewed the results away from the “don’t know” responses. YouGov told us it deliberately doesn’t include as many non-voters as were observed in the referendum for two reasons. Firstly, it expects that some of the 1,420 people saying in the survey they voted Remain or Leave, did not in fact vote. Secondly it questioned the 72% turnout figure saying incompleteness, inaccuracy and double-registration in the register mean that the turnout could have in fact been higher than 72%. Though it did say this could have improved following the move from household electoral registration to individual electoral registration in 2014. The Electoral Commission said that individual registration has improved the situation, there is the potential for further improvements to remedy these issues.  Thirdly, it said that polls struggle to contact the most politically disengaged people, and so weighting up the share of non-voters could also skew the figures by overemphasising the views of “engaged non-voters”. “Unengaged non-voters” may have different views that haven’t been captured.","

178,fullfact,"Millions of people who voted Leave did not vote for Theresa May’s hard Brexit.
","“There were also millions of people who voted Leave but did not vote for Theresa May's hard Brexit” Jo Swinson, 27 April 2017 There has been lots of commentary on who voted for each side in the EU referendum and why. We’re focusing specifically here on people’s expectations in relation to a ‘hard Brexit’, as Ms Swinson referred to.  The term “hard Brexit” means different things to different people, but it’s generally used to mean at the very least leaving the EU’s single market (as Ms Swinson referred to).  Theresa May has said this is the only way to control things like immigration. EU officials say this as well. This is because EU free trade rules for the single market require free movement of people between member countries. At the start of the year a majority of both Remain and Leave voters said they wanted both free trade and immigration control, says an in-depth study by polling expert Professor John Curtice.  The disagreement comes in what voters prioritise. Faced with a choice over whether free trade or immigration control comes first, as many as 36% of Leave supporters said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ maintain freedom of movement in return for free trade, compared to 74% of Remain voters, at least when confronted out of the blue by a pollster.   At least half of Remain voters were found to back some policies that the research defined as parts of a hard Brexit as well.  This is all debatable. There is no set definition of a hard and soft Brexit, and we don’t yet know what the trade offs will be during the negotiations.  What this polling does show is that we should beware of making strong claims about what voters on either side think: there are Remainers sympathising with “Leave” positions, and Leavers sympathising with “Remain” positions.    For a broader examination of the reasons behind voters’ decisions last June, social researchers at NatCen have published extensive analysis. Update 28 June 2017  We updated the wording of the piece to make it clearer and to emphasise the limitations of what the polling is able to tell us.  This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","We can’t know for certain. More recent polling could be used to show this—if being against a “hard Brexit” is defined as prioritising free trade over immigration control.

179,fullfact,"Options for post-Brexit trade deals with the EU will lead to between 2% and 8% lower GDP.
","This graphic has been shared widely on social media. Just one tweet sharing it has received over 15,000 retweets at the time of writing. It’s based on government analysis, produced in January, of three possible post-Brexit trade scenarios with the EU (none of the three possible deals are as detailed as the government's recent white paper on the matter). The analysis compares how each deal might affect the economy. The graphic’s reporting of the analysis is highly misleading. For a start, the government report explicitly states that it’s based on hypothetical modelling and should not be used to make economic forecasts for each trade deal. This means it can’t be used—as the graphic does—to estimate the future size of GDP, or number of jobs. Even if we ignore this, most of the figures reported by the graphic are still incorrect. The GDP figures are roughly accurate, but the phrasing may be confusing—the government analysis still expects GDP to grow in each scenario, just more slowly. So “8% lower GDP” under “no deal” means GDP will still have grown, but more slowly than on the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) latest economic forecasts, over a fifteen year period. The “less per year” figures are wrong, as they refer to the how much less the economy might grow by over fifteen years, not every year. And there is no evidence for the estimated job losses they report in either the government analysis or wider research. To begin with, it’s important to clarify that the government analysis on which this graphic is based explicitly says that this is not a forecast for what will actually happen to the economy in each scenario. It’s only to give a comparative sense of each deal’s potential impact. The government uses the OBR's current economic forecasts up to 2023 (and then extrapolates them over 15 years) in order to create a baseline for economic growth. They then model three different Brexit scenarios against this baseline, and show how GDP growth varies in each one. But the report recognises that future economic uncertainty could affect the analysis, and also that it doesn’t account for short-term impacts from Brexit—so it’s not an official economic forecast for each trade deal. Although it’s not a forecast, the analysis does give an indication of the comparative impact of different trade deals. GDP is not expected to fall in any of the three Brexit scenarios, but it is expected to grow more slowly in each scenario over a 15 year period (with the caveats outlined above about the uncertain path of growth, and there being no modelling of short-term impacts). For instance, growth is expected to be around 17% over 15 years based on the no deal model, compared to 25% on the baseline model. Put another way, that’s 1.1% average growth each year in the no deal model, compared to 1.5% on the baseline. These estimates are also mid-points within quite wide ranges. This means that growth in the no deal scenario is estimated to be anywhere between 5% and 10% slower. (For the sake of clarity, this article focuses mainly on how the graphic reports the no deal scenario, but the issues with the calculations apply to all three trade deals equally.) The graphic tries to translate the different GDP growth rates into costs to the economy. This can’t be done fairly because the analysis is explicitly not an economic forecast, but even if you ignore this factor, the graphic’s estimates are still incorrect. It says that the no deal scenario will mean the economy having “£158 billion less per year”. This is actually how much less the economy might grow by over a fifteen year period, not one year. Using the 2017 GDP estimate from the Office for National Statistics, if the economy grew by 17% over the next 15 years (as the no deal model roughly estimates), by the fifteenth year GDP would be around £155 billion less than if it had grown by 25%. But in each year before that the shortfall would be less, so it’s wrong to say that this is the figure lost “per year” We don’t know what the impact of Brexit will be on jobs, but there’s no evidence in the government report to support the graphic’s calculations (which is where the makers of this graphic say their information is from). Separate research has suggested that a “pessimistic” no deal scenario could lead to significantly fewer jobs by 2030 (we haven’t verified these calculations), but it’s still nowhere near the 2.8 million figure claimed here. The graphic seems to directly translate the estimated difference in GDP growth rates in each scenario into an equivalent difference in the number of jobs. So an 8% slower GDP growth rate under no deal is equated to 8% fewer jobs, which they calculate as 2.8 million fewer jobs. (They don’t specify if this is job losses, or simply a slower increase in the rate of jobs, nor what time period this relates to.) But that’s not how the growth rates of GDP and jobs are related. 2.8 million jobs lost over 15 years, while the economy continues to grow, would be unprecedented. If the assumption is that jobs continue to rise, but by 2.8 million less, then the implication is that the rate of jobs growth and the rate of GDP growth are identical. That’s not how it works. The graph below shows that, while changes in GDP growth and job numbers generally track each other, GDP tends to rise and fall more sharply than jobs. As an illustration of how unlikely it is that GDP growth and jobs growth would exactly match each other, as this claim assumes: if jobs grew at the rate GDP is expected to grow under the baseline model, then within the next few decades there would be millions more jobs than there were adults of working age in the country (based on the ONS’s population projections). Which is pretty implausible, even if lots of people work two jobs. It should also be noted that the scenarios modelled by the government report are all quite general. They don’t have anything like the level of detail that, for instance, the government’s Brexit white paper has, in terms of the minutiae of trade agreements. Any Brexit deal we do strike will not exactly resemble the EEA-Type or FTA-Type scenarios of the report. And neither do the OBR’s forecasts, used as a baseline in the report, amount to a “remain” scenario, as the graphic suggests. The OBR forecasts are based on economic projections for the UK at present—a country which is in the process of leaving the EU, having triggered Article 50 and committed vast governmental resources to planning and negotiating Brexit—not a hypothetical scenario in which we decide to remain in the EU.","This is based on government analysis of 3 hypothetical deals, which explicitly can’t be used as economic forecasts and are very uncertain. According to the analysis GDP will continue to grow over the next fifteen years in each case, but more slowly than on existing OBR projections.

Options for post-Brexit trade deals with the EU will lead to between £39 billion and £158 billion less per year.
","This graphic has been shared widely on social media. Just one tweet sharing it has received over 15,000 retweets at the time of writing. It’s based on government analysis, produced in January, of three possible post-Brexit trade scenarios with the EU (none of the three possible deals are as detailed as the government's recent white paper on the matter). The analysis compares how each deal might affect the economy. The graphic’s reporting of the analysis is highly misleading. For a start, the government report explicitly states that it’s based on hypothetical modelling and should not be used to make economic forecasts for each trade deal. This means it can’t be used—as the graphic does—to estimate the future size of GDP, or number of jobs. Even if we ignore this, most of the figures reported by the graphic are still incorrect. The GDP figures are roughly accurate, but the phrasing may be confusing—the government analysis still expects GDP to grow in each scenario, just more slowly. So “8% lower GDP” under “no deal” means GDP will still have grown, but more slowly than on the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) latest economic forecasts, over a fifteen year period. The “less per year” figures are wrong, as they refer to the how much less the economy might grow by over fifteen years, not every year. And there is no evidence for the estimated job losses they report in either the government analysis or wider research. To begin with, it’s important to clarify that the government analysis on which this graphic is based explicitly says that this is not a forecast for what will actually happen to the economy in each scenario. It’s only to give a comparative sense of each deal’s potential impact. The government uses the OBR's current economic forecasts up to 2023 (and then extrapolates them over 15 years) in order to create a baseline for economic growth. They then model three different Brexit scenarios against this baseline, and show how GDP growth varies in each one. But the report recognises that future economic uncertainty could affect the analysis, and also that it doesn’t account for short-term impacts from Brexit—so it’s not an official economic forecast for each trade deal.

180,fullfact,"The Institute for Public Policy Research found household bills will rise by between £245 and £1,961 a year after Brexit.
","“The Institute for Public Policy Research found household bills will rise by between £245 and £1,961 a year after #Brexit, with a disproportionately adverse impact on lower-income groups and regions outside London.” Renew Party, 18 July 2018.  This is a case of a series of crossed wires. The estimated household cost increase following a “hard Brexit” was £961, not £1,961, and was calculated by consultancy Oliver Wyman, not think tank The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). Oliver Wyman estimated that a “hard Brexit” scenario with World Trade Organisation tariffs would add 4%, or £961, onto average annual household costs. The Brexit scenario with the lowest impact on bills (a “moderate amount of red tape” scenario”) would increase annual household costs by 1% or £245, as the graphic correctly states. The £1,961 figure originates from a typo in an article by the Guardian which has since been corrected. That article discussed both the Oliver Wyman report and a separate report by the IPPR looking at the possible effects of Brexit on income inequality, which may be the source of confusion. The claim that IPPR said Brexit will have a disproportionately adverse impact on lower-income groups and regions outside London isn’t quite right. In fact the IPPR said that “price impacts have a broadly neutral effect on income inequality”, adding that “while Brexit is unlikely to worsen income inequality, all income groups – including the poorest - will face negative impacts.” They do however note that lower income households have “less of a ‘buffer’ to protect them from increased prices”. The Oliver Wyman report said a “hard Brexit” scenario could increase costs for low-income households by 3% more than high income-households. They also said a different scenario, with increased labour costs, could flip that situation – with household costs for higher earners increasing by 4% more than for lower earners.   As for geographical inequality, the IPPR said the regional effects of Brexit on jobs are hard to determine with certainty but that “most studies suggest that in the long run it is areas outside London and the South East that are most likely to suffer from a downturn.” With regards to household costs, it estimated that regions outside London would be most affected saying: “London is least affected because a greater proportion of households’ expenditure goes on housing costs, which are not expected to be significantly impacted by Brexit.” Nevertheless it acknowledged dissenting views such as analysis from the London School of Economics which, on jobs, said that service sectors would be more negatively affected by Brexit than other sectors, and that because London and the South East have the highest concentration of services industries, those regions will be hit the hardest by Brexit. The IPPR concluded by saying: “Our analysis suggests that claims that Brexit will benefit the worst off or entrench inequalities further as too simplistic.

154,fullfact,"Most of our trade with the world is based on WTO rules.
","“There are WTO rules which govern world trade, and most of our dealings with most countries in the world are based on WTO rules.” Charles Moore, 12 July 2018 Most of the UK’s trade is with the EU or countries the EU has trade agreements with—about 57% of our exports and 66% of our imports in 2016. That means it doesn’t happen under standard World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. But EU trade agreements don’t affect tariffs on all goods and services. Some goods and services have the same tariff level for countries the EU has trade agreements with and those it doesn’t. If the UK were to leave the EU with “no deal”, we would go back to trading under WTO terms with these countries. In a nutshell, the WTO is an international organisation aiming to reduce all barriers to trade. Most countries around the world are members, including the UK. The WTO requires member countries to apply tariffs (taxes) on goods and services to other WTO countries equally. It also means you can’t set different rules for foreign and domestic products in your country. The big exception is if countries have negotiated their own customs union or free trade area. You can read more about how the WTO works here. The main exception to WTO trade rules that apply to the UK is that we’re a member of the EU customs union and so have free trade with other EU members. In 2016 44% of our exports in goods and services went to other EU countries and 54% of our goods and services imports came from EU countries. The EU also has trade agreements with other countries, like Israel and South Korea.  Countries where there is an EU trade agreement in place accounted for a further 12% of our imports and 13% of our exports. The EU also has “preferential trade agreements” with various other countries. This is where one country grants preferential tariffs on imports from developing countries. As these arrangements are unilateral (they’re one way and so don’t require a two-way trade deal), we’ve not included these countries in our calculations. So in total 57% of our exports and 66% of our imports happen with countries we have some trade agreement with as part of the EU. The EU has also negotiated or is in the process of negotiating trade deals with other countries, including Japan and Australia.   Free trade agreements that change tariffs between countries from the WTO default don’t necessarily affect all goods and services. While 57% of the UK’s exports go to the EU or other countries with which we have some kind of trade agreement, that doesn’t mean that a “no deal” situation would mean new tariffs on 57% of our exports. For example, take bottled beer. At the moment the EU, and therefore the UK, has no trade deal with  the USA and it pays no tariffs on the bottled beer it exports there. If the UK was to revert to trading with the EU under WTO rules following Brexit, there would similarly be no tariffs on the export of UK bottled beer to the EU. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Most of our trade (57% of exports and 66% of imports in 2016) is with countries we have EU trade agreements with, not under WTO rules. But trade agreement tariffs on some goods and services are the same as those we have with other countries.

Getting rid of EU customs union tariffs when we leave will help the worst off.
","“When we leave, we can set our own tariffs. Tariffs set at the European level make food, clothing and footwear more expensive. They are the highest proportion of the poorest in society’s expenditure. If we can get rid of those tariffs, we help the worst off in society.” Jacob Rees-Mogg, 26 October 2017 It’s correct that, after leaving the EU customs union, the UK would be able to choose what tariffs—which are basically taxes on imports or exports—it puts on imports from other countries. The UK wouldn’t have a completely free hand to do this, however. At the moment, the UK can’t do this because the EU sets a Common External Tariff on anyone it doesn't have a trade deal with. Higher tariffs mean products can be more expensive after they’ve been imported. The EU sets relatively high import tariffs on agricultural products compared to everything else. The average EU tariff on agriculture was roughly 11% in 2016, compared to about 4% for other products. Tariffs on dairy products are as high as 36% on average, those on clothing can average just under 12%, and those on footwear face about 4%. Mr Rees-Mogg also claims food, drink and clothing make up the highest proportion of the poorest households’ spending. What makes up the biggest chunk depends on how you categorise different kinds of spending, but these items certainly make up a big part of what low earners spend each week. The latest figures for these are for 2015/16, from the Office for National Statistics. The lowest-earning 10% of households spend about 17% of their weekly income on food and non-alcoholic drinks. Another 4.5% goes on clothes and 4% goes on alcohol. Meanwhile a full 22% goes on housing and fuel. The highest-earning 10% are very different. They spend 7.5% on food and drink, 4% on clothes and 1.5% on alcohol. Their biggest items are transport (16%) and leisure (13.5%). So does this mean getting rid of tariffs will help the worst off? It’s likely that lower tariffs will help with the cost of certain products, but it’s also just one part of a bigger picture. Tariffs aren’t the only thing that will affect household incomes after Brexit. The value of the pound has fallen since the referendum, and that has increased pressure on food and drink prices for everyone. Despite previous inaccurate predictions (covered above), economists generally expect there to be a negative impact on the UK’s economic growth in the coming years as a result of leaving the EU. If that happens household incomes will be lower than they otherwise would have been. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","

41,fullfact,"If we left the EU without an alternative trade deal in place then we’d still have a choice about whether to put tariffs on imports.
","“Would we need to apply tariffs on goods coming into this country if we were out of the [EU] customs union? No we would not – that would be a voluntary choice for us, there is no need for tariffs.” Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, 16 March 2017 It’s correct that the UK would be able to choose what tariffs it put on imports from other countries, after it left the EU customs union. The UK wouldn’t have a completely free hand to do this. It would have to apply the same rates to all other WTO members, except where it has a free trade agreement or is giving preferences to developing countries. It would also have to keep those tariffs within limits agreed in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). And we wouldn’t have a choice about what tariffs were put on our exports. Mr Rees-Mogg went some way to making the same point about exports when he added: “We would be in a very strong position to retaliate if vicious tariffs were imposed on us.” Whether or not we’d be in a “strong position” to respond is a more complicated and speculative question than we can confirm or deny in a factcheck. We can say that any tariffs would have to conform with limits agreed in the World Trade Organisation, and also that other countries wouldn’t be able to pick on the UK and impose specific tariffs on UK-made goods or services (or vice versa). The UK will still be a member of the WTO after it leaves the EU (there will be negotiations about the details of the UK’s membership status outside the EU, although there’s some debate about how difficult these will be). Members of the WTO have to put the same tariffs on every trading partner worldwide, unless they are part of a customs union or have some kind of free trade agreement. The EU customs union is one such agreement. That’s why there’s often disagreement about whether to think of the EU as essentially pro-free trade or protectionist. It removes tariff barriers between its members, negotiates Free Trade deals on behalf of all of them, and imposes a Common External Tariff on anyone it doesn't have a trade deal with. The EU also tries to eliminate other barriers to free trade among its members, like non-tariff barriers, and there’s a question about whether the UK will have the same influence over these things once it leaves the customs union. Non-tariff barriers include things like common safety standards and professional regulations. Businesses find it harder to sell goods and services in other countries if they aren’t the same. Correction 28 March 2017  The factcheck now refers to the debate about the UK’s WTO commitments outside of the EU, and puts more emphasis on how they will act as a constraint on what tariffs it could set. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","That’s correct. In general we’d have to apply the same tariffs to all our trading partners and keep them within limits agreed at the World Trade Organisation. It would be up to other countries, not us, to choose whether to charge tariffs on our exports.

155,fullfact,"60% of our trade is through EU trade agreements.
","“In the modern world, 60% of our trade, if you count all the EU deals that we're members of, 60% of our trade is in trade agreements.”    Ken Clarke MP, 1 March 2018 In 2016, around 54% of the UK’s exports were to countries which had trade deals in place or provisionally in place with the EU (including EU member states). 60% is a little high, according to our calculations. These deals are designed to make trade easier, with fewer tariffs in place. As the UK is currently part of the EU, it traded with those countries through the EU agreements in 2016. When the UK leaves the EU, it will leave those trade agreements, but will then be able to negotiate its own separate agreements with states. We can’t say for certain how this will affect the UK’s exports. Research by the think tank Open Europe in 2015 estimated that 59% of UK exports were via EU trade agreements, but we haven’t verified that calculation. Trade agreements set special rules between trading partners, with the aim of making trade easier. One example is the EU Customs Union, which removes customs duties and checks between trading partners. It also ensures that all partners set the same tariffs on imports from outside the Union (ensuring members don’t set lower tariffs for non-Union members). The EU has two other kinds of free trade agreement in place: agreements which remove or reduce tariffs between trading partners (without harmonising tariffs on other foreign imports), and agreements which “provide a general framework for bilateral economic relations” but do not change customs tariffs. As a current EU member state, the UK is a part of all of these agreements, and cannot negotiate separate agreements. The UK will no longer be a part of these agreements when it leaves the EU, so will be able to negotiate its own separate agreements. It’s roughly 60-70 outside of the EU. It’s not easy to tell exactly how many countries are involved, as some agreements are not fully negotiated, or not all partners have signed up yet. As an EU member, the UK can trade tariff-free with all 27 other EU member states through the single market. On top of this, the EU lists 31 states or territories with which it has some kind of trade agreement fully in place (in a few cases this gives them access to the single market). The EU lists over 30 more countries where agreements have been provisionally applied—meaning that the agreement has not yet been ratified by every signatory state (which includes all EU member states). It’s unclear what that means in every specific case, but moving from a provisional to full application can take years to complete, and a lot of the agreement can still start to happen in practice, before the formal process is completed. For instance, a free trade deal with Canada was provisionally applied in September 2017, and all aspects are in force except for a few relating to investment. In 2016, around 53% of UK trade went to states with which the EU had a trade agreement fully in place. That rises to 54% if we include all states where an agreement was provisionally in place by January 2016. 43% of UK exports went to the European Union in 2016, rising to 49% when including other members of the EU Customs Union and European Free Trade Association. The number of EU trade partners has risen since then. In 2016, Canada and several African countries were not part of trade agreements with the EU—so are not included in the 54% figure, but would be counted as EU trading partners today. Japan concluded an agreement with the EU in December 2017, but it has not yet been signed—so is yet to be “provisionally applied”. Armenia, Singapore, and Vietnam are also recorded as having agreements “pending”. Together, Canada and Japan accounted for 4% of UK exports in 2016, with no EU trade agreement in place to facilitate trade. We don’t know how UK trade with Canada and Japan will be affected after Brexit, now that they have provisional/pending trade agreements with the EU. If you count the countries as a block, the EU is the UK’s single biggest export market. The second biggest market is the USA (18% of UK exports)—which is not part of a trade agreement with the EU. Other notable economies which aren’t part of EU trade agreements are China (3% of UK exports) and India (1% of UK exports). The EU says it has been or is negotiating deals with the USA, China, and India (among others). It’s unclear how advanced the negotiations are though, and those with the USA have been put on hold. After leaving the EU, the UK may negotiate its own trade deals with these countries, although we don’t yet know if this will happen. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","In 2016, around 54% of UK exports went to states with which the EU had a full or provisional trade agreement (including EU member states).

The UK has a trade surplus with America.
","“We have actually a trade surplus at the moment with America, although it’s a fairly modest sum of money involved. Whereas obviously we have something in the region of 65 to 70 billion trade deficit on an annual basis with the EU.” BBC Question Time audience member, 30 November 2017 Our trade surplus with the USA was about £34 billion in the year to June 2017, using figures from the Office for National Statistics. We had a trade deficit with the EU of around £80 billion in the same time period. The UK had a trade surplus with the USA of around £34 billion in the year to June 2017, so we export more to them than we import. In terms of services, the UK had a surplus of over £23 billion, and in terms of goods we had a surplus of over £10 billion in that time. The USA accounted for 18% of UK exports in that period, and 11% of our imports came from the USA. The UK ran a trade deficit with the EU of around £80 billion in year to June 2017, so we export less than we import. In 2015, the trade deficit was about £66 billion—which might be what the audience member was referring to. This is primarily driven by goods—the UK  had a trade deficit of just under £97 billion with the EU during that time. In terms of services, we had a surplus of £17 billion. EU member states accounted for 43% of UK exports and 54% of imports.You can read more about the UK’s trade with the EU here. Although they are produced by the government, we should not treat the numbers presented here as exact. This is because of something called “trade asymmetries”. Each country records its imports and exports separately. Trade asymmetries occur when two partner countries record the same transaction as being of different values. So, say the UK sells the USA 500 bottles of whisky, the UK may record it as worth $50,000, whereas the USA records it as $49,000. This can be for a variety of reasons including differences in the way values are converted, the timing of the transaction being recorded and methodological differences. Trade relations are complex—using a range of changing technologies and with supply chains crossing multiple borders— so it’s hard to measure these relations exactly. These can lead to quite dramatic differences. In 2014 the UK recorded that it had a services trade surplus of $44.8 billion with the USA. However, the USA thinks that should be a deficit of $13.3 billion. That’s a difference of $58.1 billion. All countries have trade asymmetries, and the UK’s are similar to other countries’, according to an analysis by Eurostat. Correction 4 December 2017  We previously said the UK's 2015 trade deficit with the EU was $66 billion. This has been changed to £66 billion.

156,fullfact,"The UK has a huge trade deficit with the EU.
","“We have a huge trade deficit with the European Union” Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, 16 March 2017 Another way of putting this is that the EU sells more to us than we sell to it. That’s correct. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that “they need us more than we need them”, as it was often put during the referendum campaign. There are other ways to look at this.  For example, UK exports to those other EU countries are worth around 13% of the value of our economy, whereas for the EU it’s only 3-4%. And while domestic producers might be happy, it wouldn’t necessarily be in the interests of consumers or businesses to make imports more expensive. We buy EU imports because we want them, not to do French wine producers or Irish beef farmers a favour. The value of the trade deficit was about £60 billion in the 12 months to September 2016. The UK imported £302 billion worth of goods and services from the EU, and exported £242 billion worth, according to the Office for National Statistics. (Figures from the EU statistics agency are different but still show a deficit.) That deficit is because of goods; we actually have a trade surplus with the rest of the EU in services. The Question Time discussion was mostly concerned with tariffs (import taxes) on goods. But services are a far bigger part of the UK economy than goods, and tariffs aren’t considered the biggest issue in international trade these days.  “With the exception of a few sensitive products where tariffs remain high, it is non-tariff barriers that are the real impediment to international trade today”, as the Institute for Government puts it. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","The UK imported around £60 billion more goods and services from the rest of the EU than it exported there in the 12 months to September 2016, although it has a trade surplus in services alone.

The US is the UK’s second largest trading partner.
","“America is our most important ally, the most important country that we have to work with, both in terms of our prosperity, as our second largest trading partner, it’s the largest economy in the world, it’s vitally important to our security. So whoever is installed in the White House, we’re going to have to work with them.” Sajid Javid, 3 November 2016 There are three claims here. One about the USA’s importance as a trading partner, one about the size of its economy, and one about its importance as a military and diplomatic ally. It’s correct that the US is the UK’s second largest trading partner after the EU, if you combine together the value of imports and exports. America is also the UK’s second largest export market. It accounted for 19% of the value of UK exports in 2016/17, second only to the EU as a whole, which bought 44% of UK exports. It's also the second largest import market in 2016/17. 11% of the value of our imports came from the US, compared to 53% from the rest of the EU. ...depending on how you measure it. If you measure GDP in terms of the dollar value of the economy, the US is the largest economy in the world. If you measure GDP in terms of what those dollars can buy you in that country - what’s called purchasing power parity (PPP) - then the US is the second largest, after China. It’s often said that the UK and the USA have a ‘special relationship’ when it comes to foreign affairs, and statements from both governments often re-assert this. Chatham House, a think tank, has said that although the meaning and implications of the ‘special relationship’ are often debated in the UK, they are unquestioned in mainstream US politics. The relationship between UK security and our relations with the US is a complex issue, and not something we can write about conclusively.

","""The EU currently represents just 15% of the world's economy and it’s forecast to go down to 12% by 2030."" Audience Member, BBC Question Time, 16 November 2017 There are two common ways of measuring the size of an economy. They give quite different estimates of the EU’s share of the world economy: 16% or 22%, as of October 2017. Both measures show that the EU’s share of the world economy is declining and expected to continue doing so. One unofficial forecast estimates the EU’s share (excluding the United Kingdom) could be 12% by 2030. One way is to look at the value of a country’s economic output (GDP), and see what it’s worth in US dollars (USD). Using market exchange rates has the advantage of being quite simple (it’s like the exchange rates you use when going on holiday), but they’re not consistent over time. A country’s share of world GDP can move up or down quite suddenly if exchange rates change. For instance, just because the UK sterling exchange rate fell suddenly on 24 June 2016 doesn’t mean that the UK’s economic output suddenly got smaller, even though it was worth less in US dollars. So an alternative is to calculate GDP in terms of ‘Purchasing Power Parity’ (PPP). This adjusts the figures to reflect different price levels around the world, and to account for how currency values have changed over time. That solves the problems with the market exchange rates approach, but creates new ones too. One issue is that it involves many more assumptions and has the potential for errors. Looked at in terms of PPP, the EU’s share of world GDP in 2017 is around 16%, according to figures from the IMF. This measure includes the United Kingdom in the EU. Without the UK, the EU’s share would be roughly 14%. This measure also shows that the EU’s share of the world economy has been steadily declining over time. It was 30% in 1980 and is expected to be 15% by 2022. These historic figures include all states who are members of the EU today. So for example, although Spain and Portugal only became members later in the 1980s, the EU share of world GDP figure for 1980 includes their economies, as they are members today. The IMF also has figures based on USD. This measure puts the EU’s share of world GDP at 22%. It shows a similar trend of the EU’s share declining over time – from 34% in 1980 to an expected 20% by 2022.This is not because the EU’s GDP is getting smaller (it has risen consistently over time). However, the rest of the world has grown faster.  It’s also likely that estimates for earlier years over-estimate the EU’s share of world GDP as only 146 countries were accounted for in 1980, compared to 190 for GDP estimates and 192 for PPP estimates in 2017. Estimates to 2030 and beyond were published by accounting firm PwC earlier this year, based on its own analysis. Its estimates suggest that by 2030, the EU’s share of the global economy could be around 12%, based on PPP figures. This estimate assumes that the UK will not be a part of the EU then. Correction 28 November 2017  We've changed the labels on the last chart so that it shows EU and rest of world economic growth separately. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","There is no single estimate, but two separate IMF figures say the EU’s share (including the UK) of the global economy is around either 16% or 22% in 2017. That share has been decreasing and is expected to continue doing so. One estimate for 2030 says it could fall to around 12% (assuming the UK is no longer part of the EU).

48,fullfact,"The UK has gone from being one of the top economic performers in terms of growth in the G7, Europe and the world to being bottom of the league in the last year.
","“It doesn't matter who you refer to, whether it’s the IFS, whether it’s the ONS, whether it’s the Bank of England. All the indicators are that we have gone from being one of the top [economic] performers in the G7, one of the top performers in the world, one of the top performers in Europe in terms of growth, and we are now nearly at the bottom of the league. And that's happened in the last six or 12 months.” Lord Rose, 23 November 2017 It’s correct that if you look at the UK’s GDP growth for the last few quarters it’s among the lowest in the G7 and lower than the EU average. It’s also much lower than other countries like China and India, but the comparison isn’t very helpful. Before then, the UK was one of the top growing economies in the G7 and was above the average for the EU. GDP is the total value of goods and services produced in a country. There are other ways of comparing countries’ economic performance, but we’re focusing here on growth as Lord Rose referred to. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said this week that once you compare various forecasts for GDP growth between 2016 and 2022 “the UK comes out well behind all of them [other G7 countries] with only Canada even within touching distance. And we don’t have to rely just on forecasts. The UK is currently growing more slowly than other advanced economies.” The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics put the UK at the lower end of the G7 countries so far in 2017 in terms of GDP growth. It was at the bottom of the table in the first half of the year The Bank of England have also said the UK’s GDP growth in 2017 so far was lower than the average of the rest of the G7 countries. The UK’s GDP growth was also below the average for the EU and the Eurozone from January to September 2017, according to the ONS. Looking at the individual countries in the EU, the UK also found itself near the bottom in terms of growth in each of the three quarters in 2017 so far and in the lower half of the league table in 2016. It’s also well behind that of countries like China and India. Their growth consistently outstrips those of 'advanced' economies, but it's not always as helpful to compare these countries to the UK. As countries that have had less developed economies in the recent past they are now growing a lot faster than countries like the UK and Germany.  The UK had the fastest growing GDP in the G7 in 2014, and was joint first in 2016. The UK’s GDP growth hasn’t been above the average for the EU since early 2016 if you compare GDP growth from one quarter to the next.   This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","It’s correct the UK had the fastest growing economy in the G7 in 2014 and was faster growing than the EU average in 2015. Various experts have said it is near the bottom of the G7 countries in 2017 and its growth is now lower the the EU average.

49,fullfact,"The IMF said the pound was overvalued before the EU referendum.
","It’s correct that the IMF has said that in 2015 the pound was overvalued. But it’s open to debate whether it’s undervalued right now. Having an exchange rate that’s too high can be a problem. In particular, it makes it cheap to import foreign goods (which are priced in cheap foreign currencies) and hard to sell exports (which are priced in expensive sterling). A country may end up buying much more than it sells abroad, as the UK does. In February, the International Monetary Fund said the sterling was overvalued by somewhere between 5% and 15% in 2015. Just before the referendum, the IMF put the over-valuation slightly higher, saying that sterling was overvalued by between 5% and 20% in 2015. Other experts, like the former governor of the Bank of England and the IMF, have agreed that sterling was overvalued. On 14 October, the effective exchange rate was 18% below the average for 2015. That’s the value of sterling compared to a range of other currencies used by the UK’s most important trading partners. If nothing had changed since the IMF’s recommendations were made, it could mean sterling was now undervalued. But other things have changed. When the IMF made these judgements it assumed the UK would vote to remain in the EU. In the IMF’s view, the value of the pound might need to be even lower now that the UK has voted to leave.   That’s because leaving the EU single market would mean other countries would put tariffs (taxes) on imports from the UK. Higher tariffs would make imports from the UK more expensive and so other countries would be less inclined to buy them. To make up for this, the value of sterling would have to fall even further to keep the price of UK exports low. So right now it’s hard to say whether the value of the pound has dropped lower than what the IMF would recommend. Since no-one knows what kind of trade relationships the UK will have once it leaves the EU, opinions on the UK’s long-term potential for trade or the best exchange rate for sterling are open to debate.","This is correct.

This is uncertain. When IMF said the pound was overvalued, they based their recommendations on the assumption that the UK would vote to remain in the EU. It's open to debate what value the pound should be at now that we've voted to leave.

133,fullfact,"The EU says chlorine-washed chicken is safe.
","""There's no food safety issue with chlorine-washed goods because the EU themselves say that's perfectly safe,"" Liam Fox, 26 July 2017 Research from the European Food Safety Authority—an EU agency—has found “no safety concerns” with treating slaughtered chicken with chlorine. That said, it and other bodies have also said this practice might not be sufficient for maintaining good hygiene standards throughout the slaughter process. The EU continues to ban imports of chlorine-washed chicken from the US. After Brexit, there’s a debate over whether the UK should relax this on poultry imports from the US. The International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, is in the US for talks about possible future trading relationships between the US and the UK in the wake of Brexit. The poultry trade is one of the issues that the US and UK will need to resolve in a future deal. It’s controversial because, at the moment, the EU bans the import of poultry which has been rinsed with chlorine—something that’s very common in the US but doesn’t happen here. That means the UK, as an EU member, currently imports a paltry amount from the US. After Brexit, we may be able to drop this restriction if we wanted to, and some experts believe it’s likely to be a high priority for the US in negotiations. The Cabinet is reportedly split on the issue. It’s standard practice in the US to rinse chicken carcasses with chlorine and other products to disinfect them after they’ve been slaughtered. This is what’s called ‘pathogen reduction treatment’. Supporters of this argue it’s a healthy way of ensuring meat is free of harmful bacteria. Bar some exceptions, the EU bans the use of anything other than water to wash these products, so this restricts heavily imports of US chicken to the UK and other EU countries. The EU takes a different approach which it calls the ‘farm to fork’ principle. It says that’s based on ensuring hygiene across all stages of the production chain, rather than particular disinfection at the end of the process. There’s now a debate over whether the UK—outside of the EU—should drop this ban, but the EU’s position seems steadfast. The EU’s Agriculture Commissioner, Phil Hogan, said in March that: “We would never accept a lowering of our standards in the EU, and we have been consistently effective in protecting standards in all our global trade agreements.” We’re not covering in this piece what actually constitutes a higher or lower standard of hygiene. We spoke to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)—an EU agency—and the British Poultry Council (BPC). Neither said it was unsafe to eat chicken rinsed with chlorine, but both raised different concerns about the process. The BPC said it was concerned about the impact on British farmers and standards if chlorine-washed chicken from the US started to be imported. The EFSA says it stands by its findings from 2005 research that concluded: “On the basis of available data and taking into account that processing of poultry carcasses (washing, cooking) would take place before consumption, the Panel considers that treatment with trisodium phosphate, acidified sodium chlorite, chlorine dioxide, or peroxyacid solutions, under the described conditions of use, would be of no safety concern.” Similarly, a panel in 2012 said the use of chemical substances in poultry is “unlikely to pose an immediate or acute health risk for consumers”. The EFSA has also stressed that “the use of antimicrobial solutions does not replace the need for good hygienic practices during processing of poultry carcasses, particularly during handling…”. It also cautioned that it hadn’t looked at data on the by-products of chlorine use, aside from the chickens themselves.   This is part of the reasoning behind the EU’s ban. Back in the late 1990s, when the ban was introduced, scientific advisors to the EU expressed concern that: ""the use of decontamination techniques during food processing would have an adverse effect on the efforts being made both at the primary production level and during the initial processing stages. In particular … removing incentives for farmers to continue developing good sanitation in their flocks, and in neglecting the use of good manufacturing practice (GMP) in the whole production line"". This was backed up by another panel from a few years ago, which said that maintaining standards earlier in the slaughter process was likely to be better for public health “as the bacteria may also spread from farms to humans by other pathways”.","The European Food Safety Authority has said that there are “no safety concerns” with the chlorination of chicken, but it has also said this practice might not be sufficient for maintaining good hygiene standards throughout the slaughter process.

157,fullfact,"The Foreign Secretary’s claim that the UK can leave the EU customs union but still trade freely was described as “impossible” by his Dutch counterpart.
","“[Boris Johnson said] that the UK is likely to leave the EU customs union post-Brexit but still wants to trade freely afterwards. In response, his colleague from the Netherlands has said that that option ‘doesn’t exist’ and is impossible. Both of these things cannot be correct.” Angus Robertson MP, 16 November 2016 “The right honourable gentleman doesn’t actually seem to understand that the customs union is not just a binary decision” Theresa May, 16 November 2016 “Pravděpodobně budeme muset opustit celní unii”, Boris Johnson told Czech newspaper Hospodářské Noviny the other day—or so it was translated. Rendered back to English, it reads:  “We'll probably have to leave the customs union, but it is a question that will be discussed. I believe it can be done while maintaining free trade”. It’s correct that Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem responded negatively to those remarks. He told Newsnight that: “To say [the UK] could be inside the internal market, keep full access to the internal market but be outside the customs union [is] intellectually impossible [and] politically unavailable”. Mr Johnson didn’t quite say that he wants to be in the single market but out of the customs union.  He spoke of “maintaining free trade” and “access to” the single market outside the customs union. It’s possible to imagine a fairly free trade arrangement with the EU that doesn’t require single market or customs union membership.  Being a member of the EU customs union means charging the same taxes on imports from outside the EU as all other members—the “common external tariff”.  It’s different to being part of the EU single market. Turkey is an example of a country that’s in a customs union with the EU for non-agricultural goods, but isn’t an EU member and isn’t part of the single market. Customs union membership limits its freedom in negotiating trade agreements with other countries. So on that basis, it does look like there’s quite a “binary decision”: “in” or “out”.  Daniel Thornton, a Programme Director at the Institute for Government who has written about the customs union, agrees. He points out, as does EU law professor Steve Peers, that under World Trade Organisation rules customs unions are supposed to cover “substantially all the trade” between participating countries.  So the UK would have limited room to pick and choose which products were subject to customs union, and which weren’t. The Department for Exiting the European Union referred us to comments made by Mrs May’s spokesperson to journalists recently. These were to the effect that there are various aspects to the customs union, including tariffs, customs paperwork and rules of origin. It’s fair to say that with a trade agreement, some of these barriers to trade could be reduced without being in a full-on customs union. This fact check is part of a roundup of Prime Minister's Questions. Read the roundup.","Broadly correct, although Jeroen Dijsselbloem assumed that Boris Johnson was referring to staying in the EU single market when he talked about maintaining “free trade”. That may not have been the case.

","“The Treasury forecast [for leaving to the European single market] is a £66 billion loss to the economy [and] 7.5% of the GDP.” Jeremy Corbyn, 12 October 2016 This appears to be confusing the Treasury’s estimate for the size of the UK economy (GDP) with its estimate for lost tax revenue, should the UK drop out of the single market. In April 2016, the Treasury estimated that after 15 years UK GDP could be between 5.4% and 9.5% smaller than it otherwise would have been, if the UK pursues trade outside of the single market and relied only on its membership of the World Trade Organisation. Picking the middle of the top and bottom estimate, that’s UK GDP 7.5% smaller than it would have been. As a consequence of lower GDP, it estimated that after 15 years the government would collect between £38 billion and £66 billion less tax revenue than it would have done, so £52 billion on average. This fact check is part of a roundup of Prime Minister's Questions. Read the roundup.","This is confusing estimates for GDP with estimates for tax revenue. The Treasury does expect GDP to be 7.5% lower than it otherwise would have been after 15 years, if the UK relies on World Trade Organisation rules outside of the single market. But the £66 billion figure is for the resulting loss to public finances, not the economy, and it's the upper limit - £52 billion is the Treasury's best estimate.

135,fullfact,"2% or 3% of lorries going through Dover aren’t going to the EU.
","“There are other lorries, as you will know better than I do, that are not going to the EU. In fact I think it is 2% or 3% of those coming through Dover and they take a lot longer [to be checked]. And that is the reality, if you don’t have a Customs Union there will be queues.” Keir Starmer MP, 15 March 2018 Keir Starmer told us that he was briefed on these figures on a visit to the Port of Dover. The Port of Dover told us it was unable to verify the figure. The Port of Dover has provided, or been cited as the source of, similar numbers in the past. In October last year it told a committee of MPs: “Currently, just 1% of our freight vehicle traffic is non-EU”, and the Port’s Chairman told another committee that “between 1% and 2%” of freight trucks arriving at Dover are non-EU. A think tank also cited the Port authorities as its source when stating that “lorry-loads of goods entering Dover from outside the EU” make up “around 3% of the total”. These figures seem to all refer to lorries entering the UK at Dover, while Keir Starmer seems to be referring to lorries exiting the UK. We’ve not found any published statistics which look at lorries entering or leaving Dover broken down by whether or not an EU country was their origin or destination. We’ve asked the Port of Dover for more information about the figures attributed to it. The Port of Dover says EU lorries are processed in around two minutes, whereas it takes around 20 minutes to clear non-EU lorries. Other evidence given to a committee of MPs suggests it can sometimes take longer for non-EU lorries. The Institute for Government told us that a lorry from a non-EU country would still have to undergo some customs checks at Dover, even if it had passed through another EU country first. This is because even if the lorry enters the EU customs union before arriving in the UK, it won’t undergo full customs checks until it reaches its final destination, under EU regulations. Most EU lorries don’t undergo customs checks when they arrive in the UK, as we’re part of the customs union. When the UK leaves the EU, the government has said it is “clear” we are also leaving the customs union. The Port of Dover suggested to MPs that, after Brexit “All goods will have to be checked somewhere”. What eventually happens will depend on the final deal agreed between the UK and the rest of the EU. The Port of Dover says that it has no additional space to carry out an increased number of checks. It adds that, in order to avoid long queues at the Port after Brexit, checks will have to be conducted away from the Port. The Institute for Government says that what customs checks look like after Brexit is still uncertain and dependent on the on the final outcome of any deal negotiated between the UK and the rest of the EU.   It notes that “To scale [existing customs clearance] organisations up to the point where they have the capacity to manage 100% of trade would require new systems, staff and infrastructure.” The government has said that it doesn’t want a hard border at the port that requires every lorry to be stopped.","We haven’t seen the evidence to confirm this. We were told the figures came from the Port of Dover authorities, who have previously given similar figures to parliamentary committees. They have so far been unable to confirm the figures, so we’ve asked for more information.

136,fullfact,"Leaving a customs union isn't the same thing as setting up a border.
","“Will we continue membership of the customs union, or are we going to see border checks introduced between Northern Ireland and the Republic?... On Monday, the Prime Minister said the [EU] customs union was not a binary choice. I can't think of anything other than a binary choice is [sic] whether you have a border or whether you don't have a border.”  Jeremy Corbyn, 26 October 2016 “The fact that he seems to confuse a customs union with a border, where they are actually two different issues, shows why it is important that it is this party that is in Government and not his.” It seems odd to say that a customs union doesn’t involve borders. A 'customs union' is a free trade area whose members apply the same taxes and quotas on imports from countries outside it. The most famous example of a customs union, as the OECD puts it, is the EU’s version (although some non-EU countries are also part of it, notably Turkey). It’s different to the ‘single market’, which is about the EU’s internal trade rules rather than its relationship with external countries. All EU countries charge the same taxes on imports from outside the EU—the “common external tariff”, as it’s known. The reasoning is as follows (using an example poached from the Economist): “If France had zero tariffs on Japanese whisky, but Britain had a 10% tariff, then it would be a profitable wheeze to export Japanese whisky to France, and thence (freely) to Britain. So Britain would have to carefully monitor whisky imports from France, and slap a tariff on any Japanese stuff sneaking in (so-called “rules of origin” regulations).”  Such rules of origin checks are in place between the EU and Norway, for example, because the latter isn’t in the customs union. That suggests that if the UK were outside the customs union, but Ireland remained within it, the same would have to happen on the Northern Irish land border. The government took this view as recently as February, as do other researchers. Does all this constitute a “border”? As a general concept: yes. It’s a legal barrier between countries. In practical, physical terms: not necessarily. As we’ve discussed before, customs checks between Sweden and Norway are fairly light touch. There will have to be checks on products crossing the Irish border, but they might not be particularly intrusive.  Mrs May could be saying that people travelling between countries won’t experience a “border” in these circumstances. It’s true that passport controls are a different issue. Update (15 August 2017) The government has produced a position paper on what the UK wants its future customs arrangements to look like. We’ve written about it here. This fact check is part of a roundup of Prime Minister's Questions. Read the roundup.","Leaving the EU customs union will involve some sort of border checks on goods entering Britain.

GP numbers are experiencing their first sustained fall for 50 years.
","“Today, we learned that GP numbers are experiencing their first sustained fall for 50 years.” Jeremy Corbyn, 8 May 2019 “There are actually more GPs in the NHS today than there were in 2015.” Theresa May, 8 May 2019 Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clashed at Prime Minister’s Questions over the number of GPs in the NHS. Both were correctly quoting their selected figures, but the problem was they were talking about two different measures. Mr Corbyn was referring to the findings of a new report by the Nuffield Trust think tank. It found that the number of fully qualified, permanent GPs across the UK, per 100,000 people, “has fallen in a sustained way for the first time since the 1960s.” The same trend is true just when looking at England in isolation. Mrs May was referring to the total number of GPs in England excluding locums. This figure went up by around 200 between September 2015 and 2018.     Both are using “headcounts” of GPs, and these figures don’t tell us anything about how many hours these GPs are working. There’s no way to account for this in Mr Corbyn’s figures as the data is limited, but it’s possible to account for this in the data Mrs May was using. Looked at this way it paints the opposite picture. The number of “full-time equivalent” GPs excluding locums fell by 330 over the same time period. Health is a devolved issue so the UK government is only responsible for services in England. Research by the Nuffield Trust found that the number of GPs per 100,000 people across the UK has fallen from a high of around 67 in 2009 to 60 in 2018. That’s a similar number of GPs per person today as there were in 2004. The last time there was a recorded drop in the number of GPs per 100,000 was in the 1960s—although the data from that time wasn’t published as regularly so we don’t have a complete picture of exactly what the numbers were doing. It fell from around 43 per 100,000 in 1964, to 42 in 1965, and just under 42 in 1970.  The figures exclude certain types of GPs: registrars (GPs in training), retainers (those on schemes to support people with a caring responsibility), and locums (GPs providing temporary cover). The Nuffield Trust also adds that its figures might underestimate the fall in GPs per person. Factors like an ageing population could mean that we need more GPs to keep up with demand. It also says the trends should be interpreted with some caution due to the fact that there are some data quality issues, figures from across the UK are not necessarily taken at the same time in every year, and the fact that in some years estimates had to be made as to the number of GPs in a small proportion of practices that didn’t report their staffing levels. There are also problems with the changing definitions of who is included in the figures over time which mean we should be cautious about comparisons. The trend is the same in England, but not in every part of the UK. In Northern Ireland the number of GPs per person has largely been rising in recent years. In Scotland, the overall number of GPs per person is higher than in the rest of the UK, but has also been falling since 2009 (though less sharply than across the UK as a whole). In Wales the trend has been largely flat in recent years.  The Department of Health and Social Care told us that Mrs May was referring to the headcount number of permanent GPs (all GPs excluding locums) in England. The number rose by 208 between September 2015 and September 2018 (the most recent comparable figures). That’s an increase of about half a percent. The trend in the number of GPs across England depends on how you count them. If you look at all GPs, including registrars and locums, the number increased by around 3,150 between September 2015 and 2018. If you exclude all registrars and locums then the number fell by 660. In other words locums and registrars are what’s increasing the number of GPs while within that picture the number of fully trained, permanent GPs is falling. Looking just at the headcount figure, or the total number of people employed in a role, doesn’t tell us much about the working capacity those people have. To do this we can look at the number of hours they all work and add these together to work out how many full-time roles they make up, known as the full-time equivalent (FTE). The number of FTE permanent GPs (the equivalent FTE measure of the type of GPs that Theresa May was counting), the number fell by 330 between September 2015 and 2018. Looking at all FTE GPs the number rose by 270 and excluding registrars and locums it fell by around 1,180. The data the Nuffield Trust based their report on only provides headcount figures, rather than FTE, as not all of the regions of the UK regularly publish data on FTE GPs.","

There are 2.1 million A&E visits a year for self-treatable conditions.
","“NHS England said there are 18 million GP appointments and 2.1 million A&E visits for self-treatable conditions a year at a cost of £850 million to the NHS.” Daily Mirror, 12 February 2018 (p.5 of print edition) “There are 18 million GP appointments and 2.1 million visits to A&E every year for conditions that could be dealt with at home, costing £850 million.” The Times, 12 February 2018 These numbers were widely reported last week, but they’re quite rough and should be treated with some caution. We can’t comment on NHS England’s medical advice, but we can say that the estimated cost savings are based on limited evidence. We only have official estimates for how many GP appointments there were in total across England in 2008, and the proportion of these that are avoidable is based on a survey of GPs that may not be representative. 2.1 million attendances at A&E in 2016/17 resulted in no treatment being given, but we don’t know if this means they could have been self-treated. NHS Digital—which publishes the figures—says it has no data on how many patients had a self-treatable ailment. The uncertainty around these figures also means that the estimate of their cost is very rough. NHS England and Public Health England have launched a campaign which encourages patients to seek advice from a pharmacist when they have a minor ailment, instead of going to a GP or accident and emergency. The campaign is particularly aimed at parents and their children. NHS England estimates that this could “help free up GP time for sicker patients and help save the NHS around £850 million each year as well as save time for busy families”, and provide patients with more convenient, timely advice, according to a press release provided to Full Fact. There were estimated to be around 300 million GP appointments across England in 2008—the latest official figures we have. A report by the Primary Care Foundation and the NHS Alliance found that 6% of GP appointments in a 2015 study could have been avoided by patients going to the pharmacy instead (roughly 2%), or caring for themselves without clinical advice (roughly 4%). This would be around 18 million of the 300 million appointments. But that figure is quite rough. It’s based on just under 60 GPs self-reporting how many patient consultations they thought could have been avoided, covering around 5,000 appointments altogether. There’s no evidence that these GP appointments were representative of the wider GP sector as a whole, nor that the they were intended to be representative. There was also a lot of variation in the proportion of appointments that different GPs thought were avoidable. The number of GP appointments is also likely to have increased a lot in the last ten years, according to expert estimates. However, they also say it’s hard to know for certain. NHS England says that 2.1 million visits to A&E were “self-treatable” in 2016/17, and told us that this referred to the number of attendances where patients were given no treatment after arriving at A&E in England. NHS Digital—which publishes the figures—told us it didn’t have any figures on whether or not an A&E attendance could have been managed through self-care.   NHS England said that fewer avoidable appointments will free up GP time for sicker patients, and help to save money. Research done by experts at the University of Kent, for NHS England and the Department of Health, found that the average cost of a GP consultation in England in 2016/17 was £31. Based on this, NHS England estimates that the 18 million self-treatable appointments in 2016/17 cost around £560 million. But the uncertainty around the number of avoidable appointments in the first place also makes this figure problematic. The average cost to the NHS in England of someone attending A&E was £148 in 2016/17, according to figures from NHS Improvement. This, multiplied by the number of A&E appointments that year where no guidance was given, comes to £310 million. This assumes this type of A&E attendance costs the same as the average. The Nuffield Trust also told us that reducing the number of GP and A&E visits might not lead to significant cost reductions. The average cost of an appointment factors in paying staff and occupying the premises, so fewer appointments won’t lead to financial savings unless resources such as the number of staff or buildings used to provide them can be reduced too.

We have limited evidence on the number of self-treatable appointments, so any cost estimate is fairly rough. How much could be saved by avoiding these appointments depends on whether the number of staff or buildings used could be reduced as a result.

187,fullfact,"14 million GP appointments are missed every year.
","“There were some statistics I saw in the Times today that there are 14 million missed doctor’s appointments every year.” Geoff Norcott, 26 January 2017 Information on the number of missed GP appointments isn’t gathered centrally by the NHS or the government. The best information we have seems to come from surveys. The estimate Mr Norcott quoted matches a survey of 500 GPs in 2015, taken by GP Online. We’ve asked the magazine for some more detail on how that survey was carried out. We’ve seen similar figures quoted elsewhere. About three years ago, NHS England said that more than 12 million GP appointments are missed each year in the UK. We’ve asked NHS England where these figures came from and whether they’ve published more up-to-date estimates since then. And we don’t know exactly what this represents as a proportion of GP attendances either. Perhaps surprisingly, no-one routinely collects figures about what goes on in GP surgeries across England. The last recorded data on the number of appointments at GP surgeries found an estimated 300 million GP consultations a year took place in 2008, but no figures are available since then. Some reports have used trends in earlier data to estimate how many GP appointments there are now. In 2014, one report estimated that there would be around 380 million consultations in GP surgeries in 2015/16. Estimates like this come with some serious health warnings, but if that were roughly correct then 14 million missed appointments, as a ballpark figure, would represent something like 3-4% of all GP appointments in the year that GP Online carried out their survey.

Japan has a larger and older population, and a higher population density, than the UK.
","A Facebook post shared over 1,400 times compares the impact of Covid-19 on the UK and Japan The post includes a screenshot of a tweet from Channel 4 journalist Ciaran Jenkins. It quotes figures which were accurate when the tweet was sent and when the Facebook post was made, on the evening of 10 May. The Facebook post then concludes that there have been “tens of thousands of avoidable deaths” in the UK. We do not yet know why so many more people have died from Covid-19 in the UK, or exactly how this could have been avoided. The post says the Japanese population is 126 million, and the UK population is 66 million. These figures are broadly correct.  It then gives a “COVID19 deaths” figure for Japan of 624, and for the UK of 31,855. If we refer to each country’s official rapid-reporting death totals, which may not be exactly comparable, then these are correct too. According to the European Centre for Disease Control, by 11 May, there had been 628 Covid-19 deaths in Japan, and 31,855 in the UK. (The latest figures at the time of writing are 763 and 34,796.)  Text accompanying the screenshot in the post says, “Japan has the oldest population in the world. The UK is 24th. Japan also has a higher population density than the UK.” These claims are essentially correct. There are different ways to measure the overall age of a country’s population, but Japan’s is certainly among the oldest in the world. Following his original tweet, Mr Jenkins added a screenshot from the Population Reference Bureau. This shows Japan having the highest proportion of over-65s in its population compared to other countries, and the UK the 24th highest. Data from the United Nations also shows Japan with the highest average age of any country on its list. The UK is 44th on the same list. According to the World Bank, Japan’s population density was 347 people per square kilometre in 2018, which is higher than the UK’s at 275. The UN gives the same figure for Japan in 2020, but 281 for the UK.  Were the UK’s Covid-19 deaths avoidable? Based on the facts it mentions, the Facebook post concludes there were: “Tens of thousands of avoidable deaths.”  As we have written before, measuring the death toll from Covid-19 is a complex process, which is done differently in different places. It will therefore take months at least to make accurate comparisons between countries. The evidence available at the time of writing suggests that the outbreak in the UK has been much worse than in Japan so far.

209,fullfact,"Children and adults have the same chance of getting ill from Covid-19.
","“Children and adults have same chance of getting ill.” The Times front page, 15 May 2020 Today the Times’ front page carried a story with a headline claiming that children and adults have the same chance of getting ill from Covid-19, based on new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But that is not what the ONS said. It actually said: “There is no evidence of differences in the proportions testing positive for COVID-19 between the age categories.” Being infected with Covid-19 and becoming ill with the disease are two different things. Just because children appear to be as likely to be infected as adults, that doesn’t mean they are as likely to become ill, because being infected doesn’t automatically mean you display symptoms or become ill. There’s good reason to believe that children have a better chance of avoiding illness after being infected with Covid-19 than adults.  Even if the Times had just said children had the same chance of becoming infected as adults, this would still be on shaky ground, as the evidence the ONS has gathered on this is far from conclusive. The Times’ online edition didn’t carry this headline.  The ONS took swab samples from around 11,000 people across England in private households (excluding hospitals care homes or other institutional settings).  It found there was no evidence that the proportion of people testing positive for Covid-19 varied by age category, though the margin of error for each group was significant. These age categories were 2 to 19, 20 to 49, 50 to 69 and 70 years and over. So while there was no evidence in the results of this survey that prevalence varies by age, that doesn’t mean we can say for sure that there is no difference in the prevalence of coronavirus infection by age. We already know that children exhibit milder symptoms from Covid-19 infection than adults. We also know that some Covid-19 infections are asymptomatic, though we don’t know exactly how many.  But that means we can say with reasonable certainty that relatively fewer children than adults will become “ill”, even if the infection rates are identical.","The ONS found, with a degree of uncertainty, that there was no evidence that the rate of infection differed by age group, but being infected doesn’t necessarily mean you become ill and display symptoms.

210,fullfact,"Covid-19 deaths in care homes are rising.
","“While, happily, it looks as though deaths in hospitals are falling, deaths in care homes continue to go up.”  Keir Starmer, 6 May 2020  “I can tell him that he is not right in what he just said about the state of the epidemic in care homes. If he looks at the figures in the last few days, there has been a palpable improvement.”  Boris Johnson, 6 May 2020  During Prime Minister’s Questions last week, the leader of the opposition, Keir Starmer, and the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, disagreed about deaths from Covid-19 in care homes. Mr Starmer said that they were going up. Mr Johnson said that they were not.  Looking at the data available to both men on 6 May, each could have claimed to be right. This is because Covid-19 deaths in care homes had risen each week between the middle of March and the end of April—yet the daily rate appeared to be flat or falling in the last of those weeks, as well as in the more recent figures from the Care Quality Commission (CQC). With the latest data published on 12 May 2020, we can now see that there were fewer deaths in care homes in the week ending 1 May, both from Covid-19 and from all causes, than in the week before.  Mr Starmer said he was referring to the slides presented at the government’s daily press briefing the day before.  These show that the number of deaths in care homes involving Covid-19 had risen for five weeks in a row, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data. As we have written before, it is possible that some deaths from Covid-19 are being attributed to other causes, especially in care homes. It is also possible that some other deaths are being attributed to Covid-19. This means it is also important to consider “excess mortality”, which is the number of “extra” people dying from all causes, above the average for the time of year. ONS data available on 6 May also showed that excess mortality had risen in each of the same five weeks.  By both these measures then, Mr Starmer could claim that Covid-19 deaths in care homes were still rising, at least until 24 April. “I accept there is a lag,” he said on 6 May. Both these measures compare deaths from week to week, however.  If we look instead at “the figures in the last few days”, as Mr Johnson suggested, the numbers did appear to be steady or falling, although it was hard to say whether the data showed a real decline. Two sources of data are available for daily Covid-19 deaths in care homes (in addition to the weekly data used by Mr Starmer and in government briefings).  The first shows the daily deaths in care homes in England and Wales, and comes from information on death certificates collated by the ONS. These include the actual date of death, not just the date of registration, which makes it easier to see the real trend of the epidemic. Death certificates take some time to prepare and collect, however, meaning that on 6 May it was only possible to see this data up to April 24. These numbers showed a slight decline in the final week.  The second shows daily deaths that care home staff suspected were cases of Covid-19, and reported to the CQC. This becomes available more quickly than the death certificate data, so on 6 May it was available up to 1 May.  However this data is less rigorous, because it relies on a provisional assessment of the cause of death by care home staff, and the deaths are listed on the day they were reported, not when they happened.  This means the data is distorted by a strong “weekend effect”, likely to be caused by staff waiting until Monday to file their weekend reports. As a result, the data shows very few deaths on Saturdays and Sundays, followed by a sharp peak on Mondays when the reports catch up. Because of this, it’s hard to see a definite trend in the CQC data when looking at the change day-by-day. But comparing the numbers week-on-week did show a fall to 2,044 suspected Covid-19 deaths in care homes in the week to 1 May, from 2,379 deaths the week before. (The data has since been updated, so these totals are no longer accurate.) “Do you think that represents a decline?” David Spiegelhalter, Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, said about the daily data during a press briefing on 5 May. “I wouldn’t be happy to put money on that yet. It’s possible but I wouldn’t say we were past the peak in care homes. Possibly a recent decline.”  Care home data is still subject to delays, but the ONS data published on 12 May does now show a clearer pattern of decline in the number of deaths. Both Covid-19 deaths and “excess deaths” in care homes were lower in the week ending 1 May than in the week before. The trend in the daily death certificate numbers and the CQC numbers was also clearer. When asked on 12 May if it was safe to say that deaths in care homes were declining, Professor Spiegelhalter said, “I think I’d say, yes, they’re lower than at their peak, around April 17, when it was about 400 a day.”","This was true at the time, by one measure. By another measure it was probably not true. Now it seems clearer that deaths in care homes from suspected Covid-19 are falling.

188,fullfact,"Hundreds of GPs are asking patients to prove they need face-to-face appointments in a three-minute telephone call, before they see them.
","“Now you need to PROVE you need to see the doctor: Hundreds of GPs are assessing patients in three-minute phone calls before granting face-to-face appointments” Daily Mail, 28 November 2016 We haven’t seen evidence that GPs are asking patients to prove they need to see them over the phone, although the Daily Mail’s headline does reflect some doctors’ concerns about the quality of care provided through ‘telephone triage’ systems. The Mail reports that about 180 GP surgeries are using this approach systematically as a way to manage high demand for their services (that's out of about 7,700 practices in England). Instead of booking an initial face-to-face appointment or receiving an initial call from a nurse, patients are called by a GP who carries out an initial consultation over the phone.   The approach isn’t completely unusual: 12% of GP consultations take place over the phone, according to a 2014 study published in the Lancet medical journal. The idea is to prioritise face-to-face appointments with patients who seem to need help most urgently, and to avoid unnecessary ones. Feedback from surgeries that have tried this approach suggests that many patients are actually quite happy to receive quick advice over the phone instead of coming in to the surgery. So the approach isn’t designed to cruelly ration access to GPs. People have a right to register with an NHS surgery and a right to treatment by a GP at that surgery. GP Access and Productive Primary Healthcare, two firms that promote telephone triage systems, told us that they had never heard of a case where a GP refused a face-to-face appointment when the patient asked for one during the telephone call. The Mail’s story also refers to “three-minute phone assessments”. Productive Primary Healthcare told us that three minutes was the average length of a call once surgeries had implemented their system, but stressed that it doesn’t advise that calls be a particular length or have a time limit. GP Access said the same, although it bases its training for surgeries on an average call length of five minutes. Of course, none of this guarantees that some patients don’t feel ‘fobbed off’ by telephone consultations, as campaigners quoted by the Mail put it, or that there aren’t legitimate concerns about patient safety and quality of care. Sir Denis Pereira Gray, former President of the Royal College of GPs, has raised concerns that GPs will miss important visual clues that patients are unwell if they don’t see them face-to-face, particularly when it comes to vulnerable and elderly patients. It’s also not clear that the scheme either saves time for GPs or generates cost savings for the NHS overall. The largest study we’ve seen found that ‘telephone triage’ actually increased GP workloads, in contrast to previous research,  since they ended up spending more time on the phone. Patients who were given telephone consultations were more likely to call back or have other contact with the NHS again over the next 28 days, so: “Any reduction in GPs’ workload from reduced numbers of face-to-face contacts was more than compensated for by a substantial increase in the number of telephone contacts undertaken in GP triage.” And since patients were more likely to have further appointments, the study found that the average overall cost to primary care services from ‘telephone triage’ with a GP, ‘telephone triage’ with a nurse, or an initial face-to-face appointment was roughly the same. GP Access has raised concerns about this study. It said that it didn't reflect how GP telephone triage services can be used most effectively, and it published a point-by-point comparison which outlined the differences between its own work and use of GP telephone triage in the study. An independent evaluation of the Prime Minister's GP Access Fund, a government fund to help improve access to GP services, found that:  ""Telephone-based GP consultation models have proved... popular and successful. There is growing evidence to suggest that investment in telephony infrastructure can be cost effective due to the GP time savings that are being achieved."" Another independent study into the use of GP telephone triage is due to report its findings in March. Update 29 November 2016 This article was updated shortly after publication to reflect GP Access' concerns about the ESTEEM study, and to include the independent evaluation of the Prime Minister's GP Access Fund.","We haven’t seen evidence that GPs are asking patients to prove they need to see them over the telephone. Some people do have concerns about whether taking initial consultations over the phone provides the best quality of care, saves GPs time overall, or saves the NHS money.

215,fullfact,"The Conservative government is investing an extra £10 billion in the NHS, more than its leaders asked for.
","“the Conservative party... investing an extra £10 billion in the NHS – more than its leaders asked for” Theresa May, 5 October 2016 This claim shouldn’t be taken at face value.  NHS England said in 2014 that £8 billion was the minimum it needed by 2020 to fill the £30 billion estimated NHS funding gap. That relies on the NHS finding the remaining £22 billion in savings. The government’s commitment of £10 billion, rather than £8 billion, isn’t as generous as it sounds. The £8 billion requested was to cover a five year period. The £10 billion counts funding for an extra year—the last year of the previous parliament—which wasn’t covered by the NHS’s spending options anyway.      The NHS is set to get about £8 billion over the course of this parliament, taking inflation into account. It’s also not all of what the NHS asked for. The NHS said that its ambitions for savings were only possible “provided we take action in prevention, invest in new care models, sustain social care services, and… see...wider system improvements”. The government’s £8 billion commitment refers specifically to the NHS England budget. Outside of this, spending on public health is expected to fall over this parliament, and spending on social care is expected to continue to fall short of what’s needed. That means total health spending in England—including areas such as public health and social care as well as NHS England—will only rise by £4.5 billion over the same period, according to leading healthcare think tanks.   This fact check is part of a roundup of Theresa May's party conference speech. Read the roundup.","The government’s £10 billion commitment isn’t all of what NHS leaders asked for, and isn’t as generous as it sounds.

216,fullfact,"NHS England head Simon Stevens has said the government’s spending commitments are a “clear acceptance of our argument” and that their case for funding has been “heard and actively supported”.
","The latest government line on NHS spending misquotes the chief executive of NHS England. The government has come under increasing fire over its claims about NHS spending: namely that it’s putting an extra £10 billion into the service and that this is more than the NHS itself has asked for. We’ve found problems with both claims and Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England, told MPs only yesterday that: “I think it would be stretching it to say that the NHS has got more than it asked for”. The Times’ Sam Coates commented on Twitter that, in defending itself from this criticism, the government has edited comments by Mr Stevens from 2015. The claim from Downing Street that’s currently circulating states: ""The figures speak for themselves, and they will see an increase in real terms of £10 billion. And at the time the NHS England chief executive said 'the settlement is a clear and highly welcome acceptance of our argument. Our case for the NHS has been heard and actively supported."" Downing Street confirmed to us this is what was said to journalists in a briefing yesterday. But that’s not all of what Mr Stevens said in 2015. Here are his comments at the time, as they were published: “This settlement is a clear and highly welcome acceptance of our argument for frontloaded NHS investment. It will help stabilise current pressures on hospitals, GPs, and mental health services, and kick start the NHS Five Year Forward View’s fundamental redesign of care. “In the context of constraints on overall public spending, our case for the NHS has been heard and actively supported.” Mr Stevens mentions that he was happy that NHS investment was “frontloaded”. That means providing more of the NHS’ funding in the early years of parliament and less money later on, as the government plans to do.","The government is misquoting Mr Stevens. He has welcomed the fact that the money has been ‘frontloaded’ so that more is spent in earlier years and previously said the NHS’s requests are being heard in the context of public spending constraints. He has since commented that it would be a “stretch” to say the NHS is getting all of what it asked for.

","“NHS Trusts are in a financial crisis. According to NHS Providers, it seems to be the worst financial crisis in NHS history. 80% of acute hospitals now in deficit. There was a time in 2010, when the NHS was in surplus. What happened?”  Jeremy Corbyn, 19 October 2016 The latest figures show that 75% of acute trusts (hospitals) are in deficit.  In 2014 the regulator reported that 80% of acute trusts were in deficit. We’ve asked NHS Providers exactly where their figure comes from. Acute trusts are only one type of NHS provider. Overall, 153 of the 238 providers of NHS services were in deficit at the end of June 2016. Two thirds of them were acute trusts. Only 8% of NHS providers were in deficit back in 2009/10, according to the King’s Fund think tank. Since then increasing numbers of trusts have ended each year in deficit. The problem varies by sector though: mental health, specialist and community trusts have been in surplus over the past three years. NHS Providers is a membership group for organisations that supply NHS services, like your local hospital. It has said that trusts are reporting “the largest deficit in NHS history”. Experts at the King’s Fund agree.  Correction 20 April 2017  We corrected a link in this piece so that it matched up with the text and showed the number of providers in deficit as of June 2016.

218,fullfact,"NHS hospitals will require all women to show their passports before they receive maternity services.
","“Yesterday, we learned that pregnant women will be forced to hand over their passports at NHS hospitals. No ultrasound without photographic ID—heavily pregnant women sent home on icy roads to get a passport. Are these really the actions of a country where it doesn’t matter where you were born?” Jeremy Corbyn, 12 October 2016 This refers to one hospital in particular rather than to all NHS hospitals, although the government is looking into rolling out identity checks more widely. It was announced on 11 October that all non-emergency maternity patients at St George’s Hospital in London will be asked to provide proof of ID or right to reside in the UK before being treated, as part of a pilot. The hospital said that “Hospitals are required to check patients for their eligibility when accessing non-emergency NHS treatment. We are not doing this effectively enough at present, and are looking at ways in which we can improve this.” It also said that patients without ID will be referred to the “Overseas Patient Team for specialist document screening”. Anyone who is not “ordinarily resident in the UK” can be charged for the use of NHS hospital services in England and Wales, except for emergency services such as A&E. There are one or two exceptions to this, such as refugees and asylum seekers. It has been (roughly) estimated that the NHS spends around £2 billion a year treating patients who aren’t ordinarily resident. EU citizens don’t have to pay. There are arrangements in place by which the UK can charge their home government for the care they receive. Department of Health guidelines say that “all relevant NHS bodies will need to have systems in place to support charging of overseas visitors…[Staff should] identify, without discrimination, all patients who may be liable to charges.” The guidelines suggest that this should be done by interviewing patients to find out whether or not they should be charged. The guidelines also say that “booking-in staff, ward clerks etc. will need to be prepared to ask for basic supporting evidence. Being unable to provide evidence does not mean that someone should be refused treatment, only that they should be referred to the OVM for further investigation.” This seems to be exactly what St George’s Hospital has proposed to do. The government is looking at whether or not patients should be required to bring identification when using non-emergency NHS England services. As with St George’s Hospital, the focus is on finding more effective ways of identifying patients eligible to be charged—which in theory should be happening already. Chris Wormald, the Permanent Secretary for the Department of Health, told a committee of MPs that “for the majority of free healthcare, hospitals do not routinely either check identity or charge, so we are trying to introduce this system”. He also mentioned that some hospitals are trialling a system of asking patients for two forms of identification, their passport and proof of address. The Department of Health told us that ""The NHS is a national—not an international—health service and we are determined to stamp out abuse of the system to ensure it remains free at the point of need in this country. We consulted earlier this year on extending the charging of migrants and visitors using the NHS. We will set out further steps in due course to ensure we deliver on our objective to recover up to £500 million a year by the middle of this Parliament.” Update 22 November 2016 We updated this piece to include information on what the government has said about the future use of identification and charging those eligible across the NHS.   This fact check is part of a roundup of Prime Minister's Questions. Read the roundup.","This refers to one hospital in London rather than all hospitals in England and Wales. It’s in line with NHS guidelines on identifying foreign patients who might be required to pay for their treatment.

219,fullfact,"£10 billion extra funding for the English NHS will pay for new seven-day services.
","“The money we have given the NHS to fund its own plan for the future - £10 billion more a year by 2020, and £4 billion just this year – covers our promise to ensure that standards of urgent and emergency care are the same across 7 days.” Department of Health, 11 September 2016 The government has said it plans to spend £10 billion a year more on NHS England by 2020. It claims this will pay for new ""seven-day NHS"" services, as well as giving the NHS the money it needs in order to maintain existing services in the face of rising demand, provided it implements its own efficiency savings. Experts doubt this is possible, saying that the NHS will struggle to maintain existing services under current funding plans, let alone expand seven-day services. Seven-day services weren’t factored in when the NHS originally calculated it may need this money. The story starts in 2013, when NHS England said it faced a funding gap of £30 billion by the end of the decade, even if government spending kept up in line with inflation. So it needed that much more, above inflation, to deliver care to a growing and ageing population, assuming it made no efficiency savings itself. It was clear at the time this money was about “continuing with the current model of care”. A year later the NHS laid out plans for how it might handle this gap. One ambitious option was the NHS itself would find £22 billion in savings, leaving the other £8 billion to be filled by the government. The plans did mention a seven-day NHS, but this particular sum of money didn’t factor that in. The Conservatives said in their 2015 election manifesto they would provide that £8 billion in government, and expect the other £22 billion in savings from the NHS. The Nuffield Trust, writing in our election report, said this still left unanswered questions on funding: “£8bn is the bare minimum to maintain existing standards of care for a growing and ageing population … “improving productivity on this scale [£22 billion] would be unprecedented” The new Conservative government followed through on the commitment and started claiming it was giving £10 billion, giving the NHS what it asked for, and more. Actually it's not as generous as it sounds, as the £10 billion counted the last year of the previous parliament, which wasn’t covered by the NHS’s spending options anyway. The NHS was still set to get £8 billion over the course of this parliament. It’s also not all of what the NHS asked for. The NHS said that for the £8 billion to be sufficient, it needs to see “continuing access to social care” and “enhanced effort on prevention and public health”.   The government’s £8 billion commitment refers specifically to the NHS England budget. It excludes areas outside of NHS England, such as public health and social care, where spending is expected to fall overall. That means total health spending in England—including areas such as public health and social care as well as NHS England—will only rise by £4.5 billion over the same period, according to healthcare think tanks the Nuffield Trust, the Health Foundation, and The King’s Fund. The government says that the £10 billion—or £8 billion—will also cover delivering new seven-day NHS services. But the Department of Health confirmed to us that it’s the same pot of money as was suggested in NHS England’s plans to cover its funding gap. Funding expanded seven-day services with this money as well isn’t going to be easy. Early evidence suggests that seven-day NHS services will come at a cost to hospitals, although the NHS says we need to treat these figures with caution as they’re based on estimates from a small number of hospitals. The Nuffield Trust, Health Foundation and King’s Fund all said in response to the government announcement that under these plans the NHS will “struggle to maintain services, let alone invest in new models of care and implement seven day services”. Update 4 October 2016 We added in the paragraphs explaining that the government's £8 billion commitment was not all of what the NHS asked for. ","The government maintains this will happen, but experts doubt it’s possible without more money, as the original plans didn’t factor in the cost of seven-day services. It also needs the NHS to meet ambitious savings targets.

190,fullfact,"NHS England estimates that 30% of A&E visits don’t need to be made.
","“This government are committed to maintaining and delivering that vital four-hour commitment to patients, but since it was announced in 2000, there are nearly 9 million more visits to our A&Es, up to 30% of which NHS England estimates do not need to be made, and the tide is continuing to rise.” Jeremy Hunt, 9 January 2017 It's correct that there have been nine million more A&E visits since 2000/01. But the research finding that up to 30% of emergency cases were of a kind that GPs regularly deal with doesn’t apply to all A&Es. The research is specific to major A&E departments. They deal with about two thirds of all A&E cases.  30% is also the higher end of the estimate. The researchers found it was somewhere between 10% and 30%. The number of yearly visits to A&E departments of all kinds increased by 9 million between 2000/01 and 2015/16. But there are three different types of A&E departments in England. Patients can go to major A&E units, the type you would normally think of when you picture someone going for emergency treatment; speciality units that deal with particular types of emergency, such as dentistry; and walk-in centres that deal with more minor injuries. We don’t have figures as far back as 2000 on these separate types. But we do know that attendances at major A&E departments have gone up by 3 million since 2002/03. Attendances at specialist A&Es have risen by 88,000 since that year.  And visits to walk-in centres, which were recently introduced, have increased by more than 4 million since 2003/04. In 2010 the Primary Care Foundation found that between 10% and 30% of cases turning up in A&E were ones that were regularly seen by GPs. It’s this figure that the Department of Health told us Mr Hunt was referring to when he said 30% of A&E visits don’t need to be made. The report estimated that between 10% and 30% of A&E visits “could  be  classified as  primary  care  cases (types  that  are  regularly  seen  in  general  practice)”. In other words, they’re cases that all GPs would be comfortable with even if they didn’t have any specialism in emergency medicine. One of the report’s authors told us that the estimate referred specifically to major A&E units, rather than the walk-in centres or speciality units which also cater for accidents and emergencies. So it’s not right to say that up to 30% of the extra nine million A&E visits since 2000 could be dealt with by a GP, as this would include the other types of A&E including walk-in centres which are specifically for dealing with more minor ailments. At most, the finding refers to 30% of the extra 3 million visits to major A&E units. Other studies have found that some A&E patients could be dealt with in less urgent settings. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine found that around 15% of patients who attend A&E could be seen by community medical facilities if they were available within 24 hours. In 3% of recorded diagnoses in A&E’s last year “nothing abnormal was detected”. Just over 11% of those whose treatment was recorded were listed as not receiving any treatment. Patients aren’t doctors; it’s not always possible to know whether you need to go to a GP or A&E. Just because someone hasn’t received any treatment or could have been treated by a GP doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t have gone to A&E for help. The Primary Care Foundation’s report noted that the proportion of A&E patients who could be seen by a GP if one was available on the day is “much higher” than those who could be seen outside of A&E if they had to wait several days for a GP to become available. In 2013, the Royal College of Physicians told a committee of MPs that they believed there was a relationship between the availability of GP appointments and the numbers of people going to A&E. The Royal College of General Practitioners told the same committee that they questioned whether GPs had the capacity to take on more work. A study by Imperial College London found that there was a link between whether or not patients could get an appointment with their GP within two days and whether they would go to A&E instead. The authors looked at 95% of GP surgeries in England in 2010/11. But they also pointed out that other smaller studies have not found the same link and that more work needs to be done in the area. Around 85% of people report that they were able to get a GP appointment the last time they tried, according to the NHS’s GP Patient Survey. This has been decreasing since 2012, when it was around 88%.","The Primary Care Foundation estimated in 2010 that between 10% and 30% of cases attending A&E were of a type that could be seen by a GP.

Patients can go to major A&E units, the type you would normally think of when you picture someone going for emergency treatment; speciality units that deal with particular types of emergency, such as dentistry; and walk-in centres that deal with more minor injuries. We don’t have figures as far back as 2000 on these separate types. But we do know that attendances at major A&E departments have gone up by 3 million since 2002/03. Attendances at specialist A&Es have risen by 88,000 since that year.  And visits to walk-in centres, which were recently introduced, have increased by more than 4 million since 2003/04. In 2010 the Primary Care Foundation found that between 10% and 30% of cases turning up in A&E were ones that were regularly seen by GPs. It’s this figure that the Department of Health told us Mr Hunt was referring to when he said 30% of A&E visits don’t need to be made. The report estimated that between 10% and 30% of A&E visits “could  be  classified as  primary  care  cases (types  that  are  regularly  seen  in  general  practice)”. In other words, they’re cases that all GPs would be comfortable with even if they didn’t have any specialism in emergency medicine. One of the report’s authors told us that the estimate referred specifically to major A&E units, rather than the walk-in centres or speciality units which also cater for accidents and emergencies. So it’s not right to say that up to 30% of the extra nine million A&E visits since 2000 could be dealt with by a GP, as this would include the other types of A&E including walk-in centres which are specifically for dealing with more minor ailments. At most, the finding refers to 30% of the extra 3 million visits to major A&E units. Other studies have found that some A&E patients could be dealt with in less urgent settings. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine found that around 15% of patients who attend A&E could be seen by community medical facilities if they were available within 24 hours. In 3% of recorded diagnoses in A&E’s last year “nothing abnormal was detected”. Just over 11% of those whose treatment was recorded were listed as not receiving any treatment. Patients aren’t doctors; it’s not always possible to know whether you need to go to a GP or A&E. Just because someone hasn’t received any treatment or could have been treated by a GP doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t have gone to A&E for help. The Primary Care Foundation’s report noted that the proportion of A&E patients who could be seen by a GP if one was available on the day is “much higher” than those who could be seen outside of A&E if they had to wait several days for a GP to become available. In 2013, the Royal College of Physicians told a committee of MPs that they believed there was a relationship between the availability of GP appointments and the numbers of people going to A&E. The Royal College of General Practitioners told the same committee that they questioned whether GPs had the capacity to take on more work. A study by Imperial College London found that there was a link between whether or not patients could get an appointment with their GP within two days and whether they would go to A&E instead. The authors looked at 95% of GP surgeries in England in 2010/11. But they also pointed out that other smaller studies have not found the same link and that more work needs to be done in the area. Around 85% of people report that they were able to get a GP appointment the last time they tried, according to the NHS’s GP Patient Survey. This has been decreasing since 2012, when it was around 88%.","
 
This is correct, but walk-in centres have been introduced since then, and this type of A&E has seen the biggest rise in attendances. Major A&E departments have seen their attendances increase by around 3 million between 2002/03 and 2015/16.

220,fullfact,"The number of GP training places is rising.
","“The government promised to recruit an extra 5,000 GPs by 2020, where are they? … “There are 1,000 less GPs than there were the day she became Prime Minister” Jeremy Corbyn, 20 December 2017 “We are seeing more GPs, we are seeing more training places for our GPs.” Theresa May, 20 December 2017 The number of GPs in England has almost certainly fallen since last year, but it’s difficult to put an exact number on it. Mr Corbyn’s figure of 1,000 fewer GPs uses figures that aren’t comparable, although this also means the actual fall could well be larger than this. Theresa May said during Prime Minister’s Questions that there were more GPs and more training places for GPs. It’s not clear whether she meant to say the first of these – which would be an inaccurate claim – as she appeared to correct herself straight away. Only the claim about training places appears in the parliamentary record. It’s correct that there are more training places available for GPs and more GPs in training filling those places. But we don’t know whether this will be enough to have 5,000 extra doctors in General Practice by 2020, as the government has promised. It’s not actually possible to accurately compare the number of GPs in England over a long period of time. That’s because many of the older figures are known to be inaccurate, and NHS Digital—which publishes the figures—has been making improvements to how GP numbers are recorded in recent years. The published figures on GP numbers in England do show Mr Corbyn’s drop of just over 1,000 GPs between September 2016—shortly after Mrs May entered office—and the latest figures in September 2017. That’s using a full-time-equivalent measure of staffing numbers, which takes into account the hours these staff are working. There are currently an estimated 33,300 GPs working in the English NHS on this measure. Last year, there were 34,500 on the records. But this isn’t quite comparing like-with-like. The main reason for that is because the older figures are known to undercount the number of locum GPs. These are doctors who provide support where and when they’re needed. They usually cover positions temporarily at surgeries, or provide an extra pair of hands during periods of high demand. NHS Digital gets these figures from local GP practices’ records. In early 2017, NHS Digital became aware that GP practices weren’t necessarily recording all of the locum GPs who had worked for them. The result was a sharp increase in the number of recorded locum GPs in March 2017. Taking this into account might mean the recent fall in GP numbers is larger in reality than Mr Corbyn suggested. In addition, if you take locum GPs out of the equation, it’s estimated there are around 1,500 fewer GPs since September 2016. Even the recent figures aren’t perfect. NHS Digital needs to make estimates to account for GP practices it doesn’t get data from. It’s still possible that the number of locum GPs, for example, isn’t being counted as accurately as it could be. It’s also not possible to compare GP numbers now to what they were back in 2010, as there were other changes to the figures since then. Theresa May is broadly correct to say the number of GP training places is rising. So far in 2017, there have been 3,250 GP training places available in England. 3,093—or 95%—of these have been filled through the main recruitment rounds. This is the first year since 2009 to show the number accepted for training via the main routes passing 3,000. The same number of places was available last year, but only about 90% were filled then. Overall, the number of places available for GP trainees has been rising since 2011, but not all are being filled. The number of people accepted for training places faltered notably in 2014, but has been rising since then. The government’s commitment since 2015 has been to increase the number of doctors working in general practice by 5,000 by the end of the decade. It restated that commitment earlier this year. The NHS has been taking measures to try and achieve this. Along with increasing the number of training places, it’s been making recruitment drives and trying to retain more existing staff. But it’s not clear yet whether this will be enough. For a start, the government itself has expressed some concerns that a large number of GPs are retiring. When asked this summer about the recent falls in GP numbers, the Health Secretary said that: “We have had a big increase in the number of medical students choosing to go into general practice, but we have also had an increase in the number of GPs retiring early. That is a problem that we are urgently addressing.” The National Audit Office and health think-tank the King’s Fund have also said it could be difficult to achieve the target given the falling numbers of GPs currently, the shortfall in training places being filled, more people working part-time, and difficulties keeping hold of existing staff. Even with the extra number of GPs currently entering training that the Prime Minister talks about, it’s difficult to say how much they’ll eventually impact the overall GP numbers, when that will happen, and how many existing GPs will leave the profession over the next few years as well. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, told us: “We’re seeing more foundation doctors than ever before enter GP specialty training, which is fantastic, but from that point, it takes a minimum of three years before those doctors can practise independently as a GP. For one reason or another, many GP trainees take longer than three years to attain their Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT). “The number of GPs in training is a positive sign for the future workforce, but it doesn’t really tell us precisely when they will enter the profession, and it also doesn’t take into account the number of GPs leaving our profession, or those entering our profession via different routes, such as through international recruitment.”","This is correct in England, although not all the places are being filled.

So far in 2017, there have been 3,250 GP training places available in England. 3,093—or 95%—of these have been filled through the main recruitment rounds. This is the first year since 2009 to show the number accepted for training via the main routes passing 3,000. The same number of places was available last year, but only about 90% were filled then. Overall, the number of places available for GP trainees has been rising since 2011, but not all are being filled. The number of people accepted for training places faltered notably in 2014, but has been rising since then. The government’s commitment since 2015 has been to increase the number of doctors working in general practice by 5,000 by the end of the decade. It restated that commitment earlier this year. The NHS has been taking measures to try and achieve this. Along with increasing the number of training places, it’s been making recruitment drives and trying to retain more existing staff. But it’s not clear yet whether this will be enough. For a start, the government itself has expressed some concerns that a large number of GPs are retiring. When asked this summer about the recent falls in GP numbers, the Health Secretary said that: “We have had a big increase in the number of medical students choosing to go into general practice, but we have also had an increase in the number of GPs retiring early. That is a problem that we are urgently addressing.” The National Audit Office and health think-tank the King’s Fund have also said it could be difficult to achieve the target given the falling numbers of GPs currently, the shortfall in training places being filled, more people working part-time, and difficulties keeping hold of existing staff. Even with the extra number of GPs currently entering training that the Prime Minister talks about, it’s difficult to say how much they’ll eventually impact the overall GP numbers, when that will happen, and how many existing GPs will leave the profession over the next few years as well. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, told us: “We’re seeing more foundation doctors than ever before enter GP specialty training, which is fantastic, but from that point, it takes a minimum of three years before those doctors can practise independently as a GP. For one reason or another, many GP trainees take longer than three years to attain their Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT). “The number of GPs in training is a positive sign for the future workforce, but it doesn’t really tell us precisely when they will enter the profession, and it also doesn’t take into account the number of GPs leaving our profession, or those entering our profession via different routes, such as through international recruitment.”","

221,fullfact,"Over 200,000 nurses have quit the NHS since 2010.
","“Labour reveals over 200,000 nurses have quit the NHS since 2010.” Labour party, 27 March 2018 Research released by the Labour party this week and quoted by a number of media outlets claimed that over 200,000 nurses have quit the NHS since 2010. That’s correct for England, but this figure should also come with a health warning. While the turnover of nurses has increased since 2010, not all of the 200,000 staff “quit” the NHS voluntarily. Some retired (as Labour outlined in their full press release, though did not make as clear in the online version), others were transferred, some were dismissed and others died in service. This doesn’t mean we have 200,000 fewer nurses and health visitors now than in 2010, as new staff have joined the NHS or been retrained as nurses in that time too. In June 2018, there were around 2,700 more nurses and health visitors (full-time equivalent) working for the NHS than in June 2010 (a 1% increase).     Over the eight years Labour looked at, just under 97,000 of the 200,000 nurses and health visitors had ‘voluntary resignation’ recorded as a reason for leaving—the single most common reason for leaving. In the year to June 2011, 50% of nursing staff who had a reason for leaving recorded, voluntarily resigned. By the year ending June 2018, this had increased to 63%. In total, around a third of voluntary resignations between June 2010 and 2018 did not have a specific reason for them recorded. Around a quarter were listed as being due to relocation and around one in five cited ‘work life balance’. Just under one in ten resigned for reasons relating to promotion. Looking at the increase in the number of nurses and health visitors resigning between the year ending June 2010 and 2018, the largest component of the increase were resignations due to relocation and ‘work life balance’. The data counts each individual nurse leaving the NHS (or the headcount), rather than the using the full-time equivalent (FTE) measure commonly used. Rather than just counting every individual person FTE factors in the number of hours they work, for example two nurses working part-time would be counted as one person working full-time hours. Looking at slightly different data on the number of nurses and health visitors leaving the NHS in England (for years ending September rather than June) we can compare this to the number of nurses joining the NHS. These figures use the headcount measure too, rather than looking at the FTE numbers. The data shows the number of leavers fluctuating, in some years keeping pace with the number of nurses joining and in some years exceeding it. The year ending September 2012 saw the largest difference, over 8,000 more nurses and health visitors left than joined the NHS. The number of joiners was larger than the number of leavers in only three of the nine years measured. Unlike those used by Labour, the figures on the number of leavers used here include staff on maternity leave or career breaks. Although more nurses are leaving the NHS in England than joining it, there are still slightly more nurses and health visitors working in the health service than eight years ago. NHS Digital, who produce figures on the NHS workforce in England, told us that this discrepancy was most likely because staff already inside the NHS were being reclassified or retrained as nurses and health visitors, so being counted in the total staff figures, but not in the joiners’ figures. Between June 2010 and June 2018 the total number of nurses and health visitors working in NHS hospitals and community health services in England increased by just over 200. Looking at the FTE figure, it increased over the same time period by around 2,700 (1%). ","This figure covers all nurses and health visitors who have left the NHS in England in the last eight years, including those with an unknown reason for leaving as well as those who have retired or died in service. Overall the number of nurses working in the NHS is slightly higher than in 2010.

211,fullfact,"There has been a rise in deaths from heart disease.
","“Shock rise in heart disease deaths — Experts call for action after rates increase for first time in 50 years” Daily Express, 13 May 2019 On Monday, the British Heart Foundation (BHF) reported that the number of under 75s in the UK dying of heart diseases and strokes had seen the first sustained increase in 50 years. The story was picked up by the Daily Express and almost every other national newspaper. But what was reported didn’t quite match the facts of the report released by the BHF. And regardless, there’s only so much this data tells us. Contrary to what most of the headlines suggest, the overall number of deaths from heart disease in the UK continues to fall, as does the rate (the number of deaths per 100,000 people, adjusted for age). The rate at which deaths have been falling has, however, slowed down significantly in recent years. There are three key things which the Express fails to make clear. Firstly, the headline suggests the total number of deaths from heart disease has increased, and the print article doesn’t clarify until the third   paragraph that the “rise” doesn’t refer to the whole UK population. Looking at people of all ages  the number of deaths from heart disease fell slightly from 152,465 to 152,405 between 2016 and 2017, according to the BHF’s data which they provided to us. The increase in deaths has been among those aged under 75: rising from 42,311 in 2016 to 42,384 in 2017. Similarly neither the Guardian, Independent, i nor BBC made this clear in their headline. Secondly, this isn’t, strictly speaking, the first rise in deaths “in 50 years”. Heart disease deaths among the under 75s have actually been rising since 2014, according to the same BHF data. The BHF calls this the first “sustained” rise in 50 years as the number has increased for three consecutive years.    So 2017 isn’t the first year the number of deaths rose, as suggested in various newspapers, but they probably weren’t helped by unclear wording from the BHF.   Thirdly, and most importantly, the Express said the rate of death has increased, when it hasn’t. Whether you’re looking at under-75s or at all ages the death rate from heart disease has continued to fall (despite the total number of deaths among under 75s) increasing. Over time the population continues to increase in size, so looking at the total number of deaths doesn’t really tell us much (as you would expect this to increase as the population gets larger). What’s more useful to look at is the age-standardised death rate, or the number of people who die from heart disease per 100,000 in the population. This figure is also adjusted to take account of the different ages of these people. For example, there are a lot more people in the UK just under the age of 75 as those born in 1947 (at the beginning of the baby boom) have reached their 70s.   Over the past 50 years the age-standardised death rate from heart disease has declined almost every year, for both the whole population, and the population aged under-75.  In fact for most of that period, the speed at which the death rate fell accelerated. For example, in 1981, the death rate was 10% lower than five years earlier. In 2011, the death rate was 26% lower than five years earlier. But from 2011 we’ve seen that trend slow down. The death rate continues to decrease, but it’s decreasing at a slower rate than it used to.    So although there’s been a slight uptick in the total number of people aged under 75 dying—which is affected by population change among other factors—there has been a “significant slowdown” in how quickly heart disease death rates are improving. ","Incorrect.

110,fullfact,"If you think you’re having a heart attack, coughing repeatedly and vigorously could help you.
","A Facebook post has claimed that coughing “repeatedly and vigorously” can help someone survive a heart attack if they’re alone. This shouldn’t be attempted, because there’s no evidence that it works, and doing so could make the condition worse or delay actual treatment. If you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, you should dial 999 and follow the call handler’s advice. The British Heart Foundation advises that “the absolute priority when you think you or someone else is having a heart attack is to call 999”. Heart attack symptoms can include chest pain or discomfort (though not always), and pain spreading to the arms, but there are a combination of other signs. The Resuscitation Council (UK), a professional body which trains people in CPR and publishes guidelines on it, has expressed concern over rumours of ‘cough CPR’. It said: “CPR is the correct treatment for sudden cardiac arrest…The majority of people having a heart attack will not suffer a cardiac arrest, and by attempting ‘cough CPR’ they could make their condition worse”. Heart attacks and cardiac arrest are two different things, although a heart attack can result in cardiac arrest. A heart attack is when a coronary artery gets blocked, stopping blood (and oxygen) getting to the heart muscle. If someone is having a heart attack, they are usually conscious, should be kept calm and 999 should be called. Cardiac arrest is when a person’s heart stops pumping blood round their body and they stop breathing normally. The British Heart Foundation advises that people going into cardiac arrest will be unconscious, and need actual CPR (and 999 should be called). You can read the British Heart Foundation’s advice about how to do CPR here. The Resuscitation Council (UK) says the rumour is likely “very loosely” based on some academic case reports of people with cardiac arrest who were able to maintain a heartbeat by coughing. Vitally, this was achieved in hospitals “during tests or treatments on the heart in which the person was being monitored closely and supervised by doctors throughout.” It should not be attempted by the public.

","“We know that 50% of mental health problems develop before the age of 14 and that 75% develop before the age of 18."" Barbara Keeley MP, 8 March 2018 ""75% of those with a mental health condition start developing it before the age of 18"" MQ: mental health charity “50% of mental health problems are established by age 14 and 75% by age 24.” Mental Health Foundation There are a number of different claims regarding the age at which most people with a mental health condition begin to develop it. These particular claims are based on two different studies, one looking at a group of New Zealanders over the first decades of their lives and the other an American study interviewing people about when they first developed their mental health condition. This is based on a 2003 study by researchers based in Dunedin, New Zealand. It examined around 1,000 people born in the town in 1972 and 1973. The participants’ mental health was assessed in a number of ways—they were given psychiatric interviews at ages 11, 13, 15, 18, 21 and 26, it was determined whether they were accessing mental health treatment already and if they were using “intensive mental health services”. There were five categories of mental health condition identified in the study’s participants: anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance use disorders, conduct disorders and ADHD. The study found that of those participants who had a mental health condition diagnosed by the age of 26, around 230 had been first diagnosed with a mental health condition between the age of 11 and 15 (or 50%) and another 110 (or roughly 24%) were first diagnosed with a condition by age 18. Looking at adults in the group who were diagnosed with anxiety, depression and antisocial personality disorder, the authors found that “adults with these disorders had usually had the same disorder in childhood or adolescence. Our study also provided evidence that most adult disorders were preceded in childhood by a variety of diagnoses”. The authors of the study say that there are “several limitations” with the study that need to be kept in mind when interpreting the results. Firstly the group of people studied were all born in New Zealand in the 1970s and the group was largely white (91%).   They said that while the proportion of people suffering from mental health conditions was similar to other studies carried out in the USA, other studies should be carried out in other parts of the world. So while it is possible that a similar proportion of young people in the UK could experience mental health conditions at similar ages, this study alone can’t show that. The authors also say their findings that 75% of adults with a mental health condition had one before the age of 18 is likely to be an underestimate. Each interview focused on the previous year in each person’s life—but there was more than a year between each interview so some conditions or participants may not have been picked up by the study. The study only looked at mental health conditions that had developed by the age of 26, so it can’t tell us much about conditions that may not develop until later in life. The study’s authors say that “examination of the developmental history of mental disorders in older cohorts is warranted.” And finally, not all mental health conditions were considered by the study. It left out a number of conditions including somatic disorders, sexual disorders, and cognitive impairments. Another study conducted at the University of Michigan between 2001 and 2003 interviewed English-speaking Americans over the age of 18. They were asked questions in order to diagnose whether they had any mental health conditions and also to find out about any possible risk factors they had. The study looked to diagnose a number of types of conditions using similar criteria to the New Zealand study. It looked at anxiety disorders, mood disorders—like depression—conditions linked to impulse control—like ADHD—and conditions linked to substance use and abuse. Participants in the study were also asked questions to determine when their mental health condition began. Although the age at which conditions first appeared in participants varied depending on their mental health condition, when looking at all mental health conditions being examined in the study the researchers found that around 50% of conditions had developed by the time participants were age 14. 75% of conditions had developed by the time participants were 24 years-old. Researchers did say that they thought the results were “conservative”. Firstly this might be because people with mental health conditions may have been less likely to participate in the study. The results may also have been affected by participants not wanting to report “embarrassing behaviours”. The researchers also thought that the age at which participants remembered their mental health conditions starting may have been incorrect in some cases. They also point out that the study didn’t account for the severity of the mental health conditions and whether treatment would be required or available for them. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact","This was the finding of an American study that interviewed people to diagnose mental health conditions and asked them about when their condition began.

The number of doctors in specialist psychiatry training fell from 3,187 in 2009 to 2,588 in the first quarter of this year.
","“The number of hospital beds for people with acute mental health conditions, where a consultant psychiatrist is on hand to oversee treatment, has fallen by almost 30% since 2009.” “Over the same nine years, the data also show significant falls in the number of mental health nurses working in the NHS – from 46,155 to 39,358 – and in the number of doctors in specialist psychiatry training, from 3,187 in 2009 to 2,588 in the first quarter of this year.” The Observer, 21 July 2018 The number of overnight beds for those suffering with mental health issues, mental health nurses and psychiatrists in training in the NHS in England have all dropped since 2009. Using comparable figures since 2010, the average number of mental illness beds per year has dropped by 22% from 23,400 to 18,300. The 30% drop claim compares years before and after a change in the way the data was collected in 2010, which means fewer bed types are now counted. The figure used in the Observer compares 2009/10 with 2017/18, which are not comparable. NHS England said that since 2013/14, the drop may have been affected by trusts reclassifying beds so they are no longer “consultant-led”, and are instead run by “multidisciplinary teams”. This is for beds under the care of consultants, so won’t cover all beds for people suffering with a mental illness.  The number of hospital beds in general has fallen over the last 30 years, despite rising population and patient numbers, mainly because of advances in medicine. The number of mental illness overnight beds dropped by 62% in the 20 years to 2009. The King’s Fund put this decrease down to the “policy shift to providing care for people with mental health problems and learning disabilities in the community rather than in institutional settings”. The number of full-time equivalent (FTE) mental health and learning disabilities nurses dropped by 16%, or by around 7,500 between September 2009 and September 2017. The figures quoted in the claim compared the number of mental health and learning disability nurses between September 2009 and March 2018, but as the number of nurses working in the NHS in England changes throughout the year this isn’t a fair comparison. The majority of these nurses (90% in March 2018) are mental health nurses, with the rest working with patients with learning disabilities. 10% of these nurses work with people with learning disabilities and difficulties, and are included in the number of mental health nurses because of a wider definition of “mental health nurses” used by NHS Digital, which publishes the figures. Just looking at nurses working in mental health, the number has fallen by 13%, or by 5,200 between September 2009 and September 2017. Following their two foundations years of training after medical school, junior doctors can choose to specialise. There were the equivalent of around 3,200 full-time junior doctors specialising in psychiatry training in September 2009. That number had fallen by around 500, or 15% by September 2017—the most recent comparable figures. There were around 2,600 FTE junior doctors in psychiatry training in March 2018. A report from Health Education England published in 2017 said not enough newly qualified doctors were “choosing/able to train in psychiatry” and that there was a higher proportion of unfilled core psychiatry training posts than in any other speciality. It said that there were “low direct transition rates” from core psychiatry training into more specialised training and that the field relied on non-UK doctors choosing to specialise. It also said the workforce heavily relied on doctors who are neither training nor consultants, for which there isn’t “a secure supply pipeline”.

192,fullfact,"The number of hospital beds for people with acute mental health conditions has fallen by 30%.
","“The number of hospital beds for people with acute mental health conditions, where a consultant psychiatrist is on hand to oversee treatment, has fallen by almost 30% since 2009.” “Over the same nine years, the data also show significant falls in the number of mental health nurses working in the NHS – from 46,155 to 39,358 – and in the number of doctors in specialist psychiatry training, from 3,187 in 2009 to 2,588 in the first quarter of this year.” The Observer, 21 July 2018 The number of overnight beds for those suffering with mental health issues, mental health nurses and psychiatrists in training in the NHS in England have all dropped since 2009. Using comparable figures since 2010, the average number of mental illness beds per year has dropped by 22% from 23,400 to 18,300. The 30% drop claim compares years before and after a change in the way the data was collected in 2010, which means fewer bed types are now counted. The figure used in the Observer compares 2009/10 with 2017/18, which are not comparable. NHS England said that since 2013/14, the drop may have been affected by trusts reclassifying beds so they are no longer “consultant-led”, and are instead run by “multidisciplinary teams”. This is for beds under the care of consultants, so won’t cover all beds for people suffering with a mental illness.  The number of hospital beds in general has fallen over the last 30 years, despite rising population and patient numbers, mainly because of advances in medicine. The number of mental illness overnight beds dropped by 62% in the 20 years to 2009. The King’s Fund put this decrease down to the “policy shift to providing care for people with mental health problems and learning disabilities in the community rather than in institutional settings”. The number of full-time equivalent (FTE) mental health and learning disabilities nurses dropped by 16%, or by around 7,500 between September 2009 and September 2017. The figures quoted in the claim compared the number of mental health and learning disability nurses between September 2009 and March 2018, but as the number of nurses working in the NHS in England changes throughout the year this isn’t a fair comparison. The majority of these nurses (90% in March 2018) are mental health nurses, with the rest working with patients with learning disabilities. 10% of these nurses work with people with learning disabilities and difficulties, and are included in the number of mental health nurses because of a wider definition of “mental health nurses” used by NHS Digital, which publishes the figures. Just looking at nurses working in mental health, the number has fallen by 13%, or by 5,200 between September 2009 and September 2017. Following their two foundations years of training after medical school, junior doctors can choose to specialise. There were the equivalent of around 3,200 full-time junior doctors specialising in psychiatry training in September 2009. That number had fallen by around 500, or 15% by September 2017—the most recent comparable figures. There were around 2,600 FTE junior doctors in psychiatry training in March 2018. A report from Health Education England published in 2017 said not enough newly qualified doctors were “choosing/able to train in psychiatry” and that there was a higher proportion of unfilled core psychiatry training posts than in any other speciality. It said that there were “low direct transition rates” from core psychiatry training into more specialised training and that the field relied on non-UK doctors choosing to specialise. It also said the workforce heavily relied on doctors who are neither training nor consultants, for which there isn’t “a secure supply pipeline”.

193,fullfact,"One in four mothers-to-be have mental health issues before they give birth.
","“One in four mothers-to-be have mental health issues BEFORE birth” Mail Online, 4 January 2018 A widely reported study by researchers at King’s College London found that one in four pregnant women (27%) in the study group were diagnosed with a mental health disorder when interviewed. But the study wasn’t designed to be representative of all pregnant women in the UK. Other studies have found that up to one in five women have a mental health disorder during or just after pregnancy. More broadly, around one in five women in England were found to have had a common mental health disorder in the past week, according to a 2014 study. The study aimed to see how effective different types of diagnostic tests were at identifying mental health disorders, and how common mental health disorders were, in a group of pregnant women. The study was based on a sample of nearly 10,000 pregnant women aged 16 or over at “an inner-city maternity service in South-east London”. They were asked questions during their first antenatal appointment about their feelings and mood over the past month and a total of 545 women were selected for a more detailed diagnostic interview. The study found that around 27% of pregnant women were diagnosed by researchers with a mental health disorder after their interview. This included disorders like depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and bipolar disorder. The authors’ of the study told us that while it was designed to be representative of the local south-east London maternity population, it wasn’t meant to be representative of the wider population. The authors also say there were several limitations to the research, including the “relatively low response rate”, the length of time between the first appointment where the women were first questioned and the eventual interview , some missing data—for example where some women declined to answer questions— and the use of only one maternity service in inner-city London. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says that around one in eight women experience depression during pregnancy and about the same proportion experience anxiety. Research by the Centre for Mental Health and the London School of Economics found that up to one in five women were affected by a mental health disorder at some point either during pregnancy or in the first year after having their baby. This was looking at a wide range of studies and the findings differed depending on the type of disorder and the stage in the pregnancy. For example perinatal depression affected between 7% and 15% of women during pregnancy, while anxiety affected around 12% to 15%. Looking at mental health conditions more broadly, a widely cited 2007 survey found that around one in four people in England had experienced some kind of mental health disorder in the previous year. A 2014 study found that around one in six people in England had a common mental health disorder in the week before they were interviewed—looking just at women, this rose to one in five. We’ve written more about the number of people in the wider population who have mental health disorders here.","Around one in four pregnant mothers included in a study by King’s College London had a mental health disorder when interviewed, but the study wasn’t designed to be representative of all pregnant women in the UK.

194,fullfact,"Self-harming by teenage girls has doubled in the last 20 years.
","“Self-harming by teenage girls doubles in 20 years” The Times, 6 August 2018 Not all of that increase reflects a genuine increase in self-harming, because measurement and reporting of the issue is getting better. The number of admissions for girls under the age of 18 because of self-harm increased from around 7,300 in 1997/98 to 13,500 in 2016/17. That’s an 84% increase. That was a decrease on the previous year when there were over 14,600 admissions. Over the same time period the number of girls in England under the age of 18 has increased by just 5%. That’s not quite an exact comparison though. We can’t say how many individual girls were admitted to hospital because of self-harm as the figures count each admission. So if someone was admitted to hospital more than once because of self-harm then the figures would count them twice. These figures can only tell us about incidents of self-harm that result in subsequent hospital treatment, it doesn’t tell us anything about those cases that don’t make it to a hospital. The figures were produced by NHS Digital for the Department for Health and Social Care. The Department says that “the increases shown in the data should also be interpreted in the context of improving data collection and reporting and increasing knowledge, awareness of self-harming and empowerment of people to report self-harm.” ‘Greater awareness’ of self-harm could include medical staff being better at interpreting symptoms, as well as patients knowing there is more help and support available for them, and how to access those services. It adds that improved collection of data on the topic, and the fact that during the period NHS Digital started collecting data on admissions to private hospitals too, could account for some of the increase.  Between 1997/98 and 2016/17 the number hospital admissions for boys under the age of 18 because of self-harm in England has increased by 4% from around 2,200 to around 2,300. Over the same time the number of boys under 18 in the population in England increased by 5%. A wide-ranging study of mental health conditions conducted in 2000, 2007 and 2014 found that the proportion of 16 to 74 year olds living in England who reported in an interview that they had self-harmed increased from around 2.4% to 3.8% and then increased to 6.4%. The study found that “It is likely that this increase in reporting is due (at least in part) to changes in reporting behaviour, that minor self-injury which people had not included as self-harm in previous surveys has started to be labelled as such.” It also said that people may have felt more able to say they self-harmed n more recent surveys as the topic becomes less stigmatised. The increase may also be down to a real increase in the behaviour. It also said “that young people who self-harmed were more likely than older people who did so to report relieving feelings of anger, tension, anxiety or depression as a reason.” The study also found that young women were much more likely to report having self-harmed than young men, but that the variation between men and women reduced as they got older.  The study also found that over a third of people in 2014 reporting that they self-harmed received medical or psychological help afterwards. Women were more likely than men to receive help. The study also found that older people were more likely to receive help. That said, the study’s authors do say that “It should be noted that this relates to self-harming and help received at any point; some younger people may go on to receive support in the future.” The figures from NHS Digital also show the number of hospital admissions for self-poisoning. These have increased more quickly than admissions for self-harm, though smaller numbers are involved. The number of girls under the age of 18 increased more than tenfold between 1997/98 and 2016/17, from around 250 to 2,700. The number of boys increased nearly fivefold from around 150 to 840 over the same time period.

195,fullfact,"3.4% of patients waited more than 12 hours in Wales compared with 1.3% in England.
","""The latest annual data on 12-hour waits in A&E show that 3.4% of patients waited more than 12 hours in Wales compared with 1.3% in England. If he wants to talk about meeting targets, he should talk to the Labour Government in Wales."" Theresa May, 14 March 2018 It’s correct that 3.4% of Welsh A&E patients spent more than 12 hours in A&E in 2016/17. That compares to 1.3% for England. Asking who is responsible for that is a complex question. The Labour-run Welsh government is responsible for the day-to-day management of the NHS in Wales, and decides how to allocate the funds it has between the NHS and other public services. But most of the overall amount of funding it has available comes from the Conservative-run UK government, which allocates a grant to Wales according to a formula. Some experts have argued this formula has historically underfunded the Welsh NHS, because it doesn’t reflect the specific needs of people in Wales. More recent figures suggest this may no longer be as significant an issue though. This is not the first time claims have been made about comparative Welsh and English A&E waiting times. In January, the Prime Minister inaccurately reported a much bigger disparity between the two countries, using figures that weren’t comparable. After the UK Statistics Authority stepped in, the Prime Minister issued a clarification to parliament, using the figures we’re checking today. Those new figures are comparable. 3.4% of Welsh A&E patients spent more than 12 hours in A&E in 2016/17. That compares to 1.3% for England. The Welsh government runs the day-to-day management of NHS Wales and determines how much funding different health services get. But the overall budget from which the Welsh government allocates is determined by the block grant it receives from the UK government, which is set by something called the Barnett Formula. The idea behind the Barnett Formula is that, if government funding of the overall services covered by the Formula changes in England, it should increase or decrease by the same proportion per person in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. So if education spending were to be raised by £100 per person by the UK government, Wales’ block grant would increase by £100 per person. The Formula also factors in if some aspects of spending on a service are already devolved. This is known as the comparability percentage, and in the case of health spending Wales’ block grant would increase by 99.4% per person rather than 100%. However, the devolved administrations don’t have to spend their block grant in the same way as the UK government does—an extra £100 per person generated by an increase in UK health spending wouldn’t have to be spent on health in Wales. So UK government spending decisions and the Barnett Formula determine the Welsh government’s overall budget. The Welsh government decides how much of this budget to allocate to health, and can set strategies to try and improve NHS performance. Health spending per person is slightly higher in Wales (£2,233 per person) than in England (£2,169 per person), based on the latest figures for 2016/17. But the Nuffield Trust points out that, rather than just thinking about population share, funding needs will be affected by regional factors like age, public health, poverty, and how rural somewhere is. The English and Scottish NHS each have their own internal formula, which tries to account for these more complex needs (such as age and socioeconomic deprivation) in allocating funding to different regions. In 2013, The University of Stirling applied this formula to overall healthcare spending needs in the UK. It found that the Welsh NHS required a level of funding 9-10% higher than England’s in order to meet its specific healthcare needs. In 2016/17, Welsh healthcare spending per person was 3% higher than England’s. An independent Commission on funding for Wales also argued in 2010 that a needs-based formula should be applied to the funding of Welsh services. At the time it said that the Barnett Formula underfunded overall Welsh public spending by £300 million per year. Yet in late 2016 the economist who led the Commission’s review said Wales was no longer “significantly” underfunded by the Formula.","Correct. That’s the percentage of A&E patients who spent more than 12 hours in A&E, from arrival to departure in 2016/17.

212,fullfact,"The number of elderly people being rushed into A&E from care homes has risen by 62% since the Conservatives took power.
","“The number of elderly people being rushed into A&E from care homes has risen by 62% since the Tories took power.” Jeremy Corbyn, 10 January 2018 Around 28,000 emergency admissions were made to hospitals in England from care homes in 2016/17, compared to around 18,000 in 2010/11 (the first year of the Coalition government). That’s an increase of 62%. This is not exactly the same as saying that 28,000 people were admitted last year though, as the same person may be admitted more than once. The figures also only count people who have finished their hospital care following admission, so there may also be some people who aren’t counted because they’re still in hospital. We haven’t seen figures going back before 2010 so we can’t say anything about the trend in those years. Of the 28,000 admissions from care homes in 2016/17, 90% were for patients aged 60 and over. Those aged 80 and over made up 65% of the total. These proportions haven’t changed much since 2010/11. Overall, 21% of adults accessing long term residential care through their council were aged 18 to 64, in England in 2016/17. There were around 416,000 people estimated to be living in care homes in the UK in 2016. The figures quoted by Mr Corbyn include admissions from care homes run by the NHS and by local authorities, private companies and charities, as well as hospices. The number of emergency admissions from care homes has increased much more quickly over this time than the number of emergency admissions overall. The number of emergency admissions in total has risen by 11% between 2010/11 and 2016/17. Health think tanks Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation say there is “very little comprehensive information available… [and] no full routine national datasets on the well-being or health status of residents” in care homes. Research conducted by the think tanks found there was a lot of variation in the levels of emergency admissions between different geographic areas containing care homes. They added that “In some instances, the level of admissions may be indicative of local systemic problems across institutions.” The research also found that emergency admissions for hip fractures, pneumonia, and mental health problems were more common in the areas with care homes. Looking at all emergency admissions, rather than just those from care homes, the King’s Fund health think tank says they are partly rising as a result of increasing attendances at A&E and a higher proportion of these being admitted to hospital. The National Audit Office also says a number of long-term factors play a role in increasing emergency admissions. One of these factors is that “Between 2001 and 2011, the number of people aged 85 or over in England increased at three and a half times the rate of the rest of the population. Older people are far more likely to have immediate or chronic health problems, more likely to need to go to an A&E department and more likely to be admitted into hospital once in A&E.” The NAO says this only explains part of the picture though. They also point to the introduction of the four-hour waiting standard in 2004, which set a target of 98% of patients being seen within four hours (now reduced to 95%). “This has focused resources, improved the decision-making process and reduced waiting times”, according to the NAO, but it also reduces “the hospital’s ability to keep a patient in the A&E department for monitoring and observation and is likely to be one of the main reasons for the increase in short-stay emergency admissions”. Another factor is shift in the NHS towards more day surgeries leading to more people needing to be readmitted following complications. We've written more about the pressures facing accident and emergency departments here. Update 9 February 2018  We've updated this piece after receiving new data from NHS Digital on the age of emergency admissions patients from care homes.","This is the increase in the number of emergency admissions from care homes in England from 2010/11 to 2016/17. Roughly 90% of these admissions were people aged 60 plus in both 2010/11 and 2016/17.

The number of EU nurses coming to the UK has fallen by 90% since the Brexit vote.
","“And in fact there’s been an increase in the number of EU staff in the NHS since the referendum.” Matt Hancock MP, 31 October 2018 “The number of EU nurses coming to the UK has fallen by a staggering 90% since the Brexit vote… The number of EU nationals leaving the NHS jumped by 14% in 2017… EU nationals have actually fallen as a percentage of those joining the NHS, and that’s on the government’s own figures.” Peter Stefanovic, 11 November 2018 All of the trends picked out in the above claims are broadly correct (even if some of the numbers are not quite right), but none of them tell us very much in isolation. It’s correct that the number of NHS staff working in hospitals and community health services in England who report they are from the rest of the EU has risen in the two years since June 2016. However, this has coincided with a fall in the number of staff whose nationality is unknown: so some of the increase could be down to more staff reporting their nationality. EU nationals made up the same proportion of NHS England staff (whose nationality was known) in June 2018 as they did in June 2016. It’s also correct that smaller numbers of staff from the EU have been joining the NHS since the EU referendum (and make up a smaller percentage of joiners). But we should be careful about saying that this is a consequence of the referendum result. The number of staff joining the NHS varies year on year, so it’s unclear what a “normal” level of EU citizens joining the NHS is. The level could have been abnormally high just before the referendum (so some level of drop-off after was to be expected).   “There’s been an increase in the number of EU staff in the NHS since the referendum.” The number of NHS staff working in hospitals and community health services in England who report that they are from the rest of the EU rose by around 4,400 between June 2016 (when the EU referendum was held) and June 2018. But these figures can’t tell us for certain what the actual increase in the number of staff from the EU is. That’s because there are some staff in the NHS whose nationality we don’t know (around 71,000 in June 2018)—so the data we have is missing around 6% of the workforce at the time. The number of staff whose nationality is unreported also fell by 18,000 between 2016 and 2018. So some of the rise in EU nationals could be down to more staff having their nationality recorded. The House of Commons Library says: “while it is likely that there has been an overall increase in the number of EU NHS staff since 2016, we cannot be sure about the scale of the change”. The information on staff nationality is also self-reported—so this may reflect a person’s country of birth or cultural heritage rather than their country of citizenship. One alternative is to look at the percentage of staff who report they are from the rest of the EU, based on all staff whose nationality is known. Staff from the rest of the EU made up 5.6% of NHS staff (whose nationality is known) working in hospitals and community health services in England in June 2018. That’s pretty much the same as the level in June 2016 (5.5%). “EU nationals have actually fallen as a percentage of those joining the NHS” People reporting they were from the rest of the EU made up 8% of new staff (whose nationality was known) joining the NHS in England in the year to June 2018. That compares to 11% in the year to June 2016. However to put these figures in context, it helps to look at them over a longer period of time. The number of EU nationals joining NHS England rose in the years before the EU referendum and then dropped off in the years after. The number of EU nationals who joined NHS England in 2017/18 was similar to the number 2013/14 and in both years they made up around 8% of all joiners for whom nationality was known. This means we should be careful of linking this sudden drop in EU staff joining the NHS directly to the referendum result. It could be that the number of joiners was exceptionally high in the years just before the referendum—so some level of fall may have been expected, regardless of the result. We don’t know what would have happened to EU staff numbers if there had never been an EU referendum, or if the UK had voted to remain. So we can’t say how much of the reduction, if any of it, is linked to the actual result. “The number of EU nationals leaving the NHS jumped by 14% in 2017” That’s correct, comparing the number who left in 2016 with the number who left in 2017. If you compare the number who left in the year to June 2016 with the year after it’s slightly higher—22%. Looking in the longer term, EU nationals have made up an increasingly large share of those leaving the NHS in each year since 2012/13. “The number of EU nurses coming to the UK has fallen by a staggering 90% since the Brexit vote” This seems to be based on the number of nurses from the European Economic Area (EEA) who came to the UK and registered to work. To work in the UK, nurses need to join the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s (NMC) register. People on this register can be working in the NHS (in any of the four countries in the UK), the independent sector or perhaps not even working in the profession at all. The number of EEA nurses and midwives who joined the NMC register for the first time rose in the years up to 2015/16 (just before the referendum), before falling by 91% from 2015/16 to 2017/18. EEA nurses and midwives made up 5.1% of the register in March 2018—a fall compared to March 2017, but higher than the three years before that. Looking at those who joined the NHS in England, nurses and health visitors from the EU made up 8% of new joiner nurses (for whom nationality was reported) in 2017/18, returning to 2012/13  levels after peaking at 19% in 2015/16. It does seem that nurse numbers have been particularly affected since the referendum. “Nurses and health visitors are the only staff group to record a fall in the number of recorded EU nationals since the EU referendum”, the House of Commons Library points out.

EU nationals have fallen as a percentage of those joining the NHS.
","“And in fact there’s been an increase in the number of EU staff in the NHS since the referendum.” Matt Hancock MP, 31 October 2018 “The number of EU nurses coming to the UK has fallen by a staggering 90% since the Brexit vote… The number of EU nationals leaving the NHS jumped by 14% in 2017… EU nationals have actually fallen as a percentage of those joining the NHS, and that’s on the government’s own figures.” Peter Stefanovic, 11 November 2018 All of the trends picked out in the above claims are broadly correct (even if some of the numbers are not quite right), but none of them tell us very much in isolation. It’s correct that the number of NHS staff working in hospitals and community health services in England who report they are from the rest of the EU has risen in the two years since June 2016. However, this has coincided with a fall in the number of staff whose nationality is unknown: so some of the increase could be down to more staff reporting their nationality. EU nationals made up the same proportion of NHS England staff (whose nationality was known) in June 2018 as they did in June 2016. It’s also correct that smaller numbers of staff from the EU have been joining the NHS since the EU referendum (and make up a smaller percentage of joiners). But we should be careful about saying that this is a consequence of the referendum result. The number of staff joining the NHS varies year on year, so it’s unclear what a “normal” level of EU citizens joining the NHS is. The level could have been abnormally high just before the referendum (so some level of drop-off after was to be expected).   “There’s been an increase in the number of EU staff in the NHS since the referendum.” The number of NHS staff working in hospitals and community health services in England who report that they are from the rest of the EU rose by around 4,400 between June 2016 (when the EU referendum was held) and June 2018. But these figures can’t tell us for certain what the actual increase in the number of staff from the EU is. That’s because there are some staff in the NHS whose nationality we don’t know (around 71,000 in June 2018)—so the data we have is missing around 6% of the workforce at the time. The number of staff whose nationality is unreported also fell by 18,000 between 2016 and 2018. So some of the rise in EU nationals could be down to more staff having their nationality recorded. The House of Commons Library says: “while it is likely that there has been an overall increase in the number of EU NHS staff since 2016, we cannot be sure about the scale of the change”. The information on staff nationality is also self-reported—so this may reflect a person’s country of birth or cultural heritage rather than their country of citizenship. One alternative is to look at the percentage of staff who report they are from the rest of the EU, based on all staff whose nationality is known. Staff from the rest of the EU made up 5.6% of NHS staff (whose nationality is known) working in hospitals and community health services in England in June 2018.

","“And in fact there’s been an increase in the number of EU staff in the NHS since the referendum.” Matt Hancock MP, 31 October 2018 “The number of EU nurses coming to the UK has fallen by a staggering 90% since the Brexit vote… The number of EU nationals leaving the NHS jumped by 14% in 2017… EU nationals have actually fallen as a percentage of those joining the NHS, and that’s on the government’s own figures.” Peter Stefanovic, 11 November 2018 All of the trends picked out in the above claims are broadly correct (even if some of the numbers are not quite right), but none of them tell us very much in isolation. It’s correct that the number of NHS staff working in hospitals and community health services in England who report they are from the rest of the EU has risen in the two years since June 2016. However, this has coincided with a fall in the number of staff whose nationality is unknown: so some of the increase could be down to more staff reporting their nationality. EU nationals made up the same proportion of NHS England staff (whose nationality was known) in June 2018 as they did in June 2016. It’s also correct that smaller numbers of staff from the EU have been joining the NHS since the EU referendum (and make up a smaller percentage of joiners). But we should be careful about saying that this is a consequence of the referendum result. The number of staff joining the NHS varies year on year, so it’s unclear what a “normal” level of EU citizens joining the NHS is. The level could have been abnormally high just before the referendum (so some level of drop-off after was to be expected).   “There’s been an increase in the number of EU staff in the NHS since the referendum.” The number of NHS staff working in hospitals and community health services in England who report that they are from the rest of the EU rose by around 4,400 between June 2016 (when the EU referendum was held) and June 2018. But these figures can’t tell us for certain what the actual increase in the number of staff from the EU is. That’s because there are some staff in the NHS whose nationality we don’t know (around 71,000 in June 2018)—so the data we have is missing around 6% of the workforce at the time. The number of staff whose nationality is unreported also fell by 18,000 between 2016 and 2018. So some of the rise in EU nationals could be down to more staff having their nationality recorded. The House of Commons Library says: “while it is likely that there has been an overall increase in the number of EU NHS staff since 2016, we cannot be sure about the scale of the change”. The information on staff nationality is also self-reported—so this may reflect a person’s country of birth or cultural heritage rather than their country of citizenship. One alternative is to look at the percentage of staff who report they are from the rest of the EU, based on all staff whose nationality is known. Staff from the rest of the EU made up 5.6% of NHS staff (whose nationality is known) working in hospitals and community health services in England in June 2018. That’s pretty much the same as the level in June 2016 (5.5%). “EU nationals have actually fallen as a percentage of those joining the NHS” People reporting they were from the rest of the EU made up 8% of new staff (whose nationality was known) joining the NHS in England in the year to June 2018. That compares to 11% in the year to June 2016. However to put these figures in context, it helps to look at them over a longer period of time. The number of EU nationals joining NHS England rose in the years before the EU referendum and then dropped off in the years after. The number of EU nationals who joined NHS England in 2017/18 was similar to the number 2013/14 and in both years they made up around 8% of all joiners for whom nationality was known. This means we should be careful of linking this sudden drop in EU staff joining the NHS directly to the referendum result. It could be that the number of joiners was exceptionally high in the years just before the referendum—so some level of fall may have been expected, regardless of the result. We don’t know what would have happened to EU staff numbers if there had never been an EU referendum, or if the UK had voted to remain. So we can’t say how much of the reduction, if any of it, is linked to the actual result. “The number of EU nationals leaving the NHS jumped by 14% in 2017” That’s correct, comparing the number who left in 2016 with the number who left in 2017. If you compare the number who left in the year to June 2016 with the year after it’s slightly higher—22%. Looking in the longer term, EU nationals have made up an increasingly large share of those leaving the NHS in each year since 2012/13. “The number of EU nurses coming to the UK has fallen by a staggering 90% since the Brexit vote” This seems to be based on the number of nurses from the European Economic Area (EEA) who came to the UK and registered to work. To work in the UK, nurses need to join the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s (NMC) register. People on this register can be working in the NHS (in any of the four countries in the UK), the independent sector or perhaps not even working in the profession at all. The number of EEA nurses and midwives who joined the NMC register for the first time rose in the years up to 2015/16 (just before the referendum), before falling by 91% from 2015/16 to 2017/18. EEA nurses and midwives made up 5.1% of the register in March 2018—a fall compared to March 2017, but higher than the three years before that. Looking at those who joined the NHS in England, nurses and health visitors from the EU made up 8% of new joiner nurses (for whom nationality was reported) in 2017/18, returning to 2012/13  levels after peaking at 19% in 2015/16. It does seem that nurse numbers have been particularly affected since the referendum. “Nurses and health visitors are the only staff group to record a fall in the number of recorded EU nationals since the EU referendum”, the House of Commons Library points out. Correction 23 November 2018  We amended an error in the claim/conclusion boxes at the top of this article. The third ""claim"" box mistakenly contained the wording of the fourth ""conclusion"".","
 
That’s correct for staff in England, comparing the number who left in 2016 with the number who left in 2017.

Theresa May refuses to allow the very best international doctors to come here to care for our sick.
","“We have 100,000 vacancies in our NHS yet Theresa May refuses to allow the very best international doctors to come here to care for our sick.” Jonathan Ashworth, 1 May 2018 There were around 100,000 staff vacancies in NHS trusts in England between October and December 2017, according to information from NHS Improvement. It’s based on management information and is not an official statistic, so should be treated with some caution. 90-95% of doctor and nurse vacancies are being filled by temporary staff—so it’s not the case that nobody is doing these jobs. However, there is evidence that temporary staff cost the NHS more, and NHS Employers says that the vacancies are leading to some delays in treatment. Restrictions on the number of “Tier 2” visas granted to people from outside the European Economic Area mean that some international doctors are not able to come to the UK to fill vacancies. NHS Employers says over 400 doctors have been refused a visa since December 2017. There were just over 97,000 vacancies in NHS trusts in England between October and December 2017, according to NHS Improvement (NHSI), which manages NHS trusts in England. That’s around 8% of the workforce. Around 10,000 of these vacancies were for doctors, and 35,000 were for nurses. NHS trusts include all NHS services except GP surgeries—and there were 1.1 million people employed by NHS trusts in England in the same period. This vacancy level is higher than the UK average for all jobs. From October to December 2017, there were 2.7 vacancies for every 100 filled employee jobs—the same level as for January to March 2018. In the NHSI data, there are around 9 vacancies for every 100 filled jobs. These NHSI figures are whole-time equivalent (WTE), so if two half-time jobs were vacant for example, these would only count as one WTE vacancy. This is the first year in which this NHSI data on vacancies has been recorded, and there are still some things we don’t know about how it’s put together. NHSI says that its vacancies data is “based on management information from the sector” so these aren’t official statistics. As we don’t know how this information was collected, it’s hard to know quite how reliable it is. For instance, we don’t know if the data was collected using a standardised data collection system, or if there was room for trusts to interpret “vacancy” in different ways. NHSI told us that they don’t have much information on this. The Nuffield Trust think tank told us that there are lots of different ways a vacancy can be defined. For instance the classification may, or may not, include vacancies filled by temporary staff, or those where the post is not currently being advertised. There are also official statistics on vacancies in the NHS in England, but these only look at the number of job adverts posted, rather than the number of empty jobs. The latest figures on this are for September 2017, when there were around 28,000 advertised full-time equivalent (FTE) vacancies for permanent or fixed-term jobs. Across the three months from July to September 2017 there were around 88,000 vacancies advertised. 81% of these jobs were permanent ones. But as these figures look at the number of adverts, rather than individual vacancies specifically, they can’t be used to say exactly how many empty posts there were in the NHS in England. One advert can be used to fill one vacancy or several, and NHS trusts don’t have to use the system that records these figures. So this isn’t a complete figure for vacancies, only the minimum possible number. According to the NHSI data, 95% of doctor vacancies, and 90-95% of nursing vacancies were being filled by temporary staff. These are either supplied by the NHS Staff Bank, or an agency. So many of these vacancies are actually occupied by temporary staff. Is this a problem in itself? One issue is cost. NHS Improvement notes that, while trusts underspent on agency staff by about £108 million compared to what was planned in October-December 2017, they overspent on bank staff by £664 million. The National Audit Office noted in 2014/15 that “Previous reports suggest that agency doctors routinely earn 50% more than permanent staff, and hospitals might pay up to £3,500 for a doctor to work a single shift.” There is also the question of whether the widespread use of temporary staff affects patient care. The Nuffield Trust, focusing on nurses in particular, says “relatively little” is known about this. NHS Employers says that failing to recruit doctors leads to shortages on rotas, extra costs, delays in treatment, and clinics being cancelled. Despite these vacancies, there are numerous reports that doctors being recruited from abroad have been denied visas by the Home Office. NHS Employers says it has heard that, since December 2017 “at least 400 doctors who we’ve being trying to recruit to come and work within the NHS in England haven’t been able to enter the country and take up posts.” This is happening because of a cap on the number of Tier 2 visas being granted by the government. That’s the type of visa which doctors from countries outside the European Economic Area normally need in order to work here. Around 1,300 Tier 2 visas were granted in March 2018, and around 2,200 in April 2018. In January, the government estimated that a third of Tier 2 visas went to the NHS. Priority is given to visa applicants for jobs where there is considered to be a “shortage” in the UK. Nurses, and some doctor roles, are on the “shortage occupation list”. Because visa applications are oversubscribed, the minimum salary level needed to get a visa for non-shortage occupations is inflated. Without oversubscription it would be £30,000 (in most cases), but in March it was £60,000, and in April it was £50,000. Some, but not all, doctors earn that much. We’ve written more about how salary thresholds are calculated and set here. NHS Employers says that the biggest NHS shortages are among nurses. Because nurses are a shortage occupation, they get Tier 2 visas as a priority—but that means the NHS has “fewer work permits available for doctors” who aren’t in a shortage role. NHS Employers argues that applicants for shortage occupations shouldn’t be included in the cap on Tier 2 visas, which would free up more visas for doctors in non-shortage roles.","
 
The government limits the number of Tier 2 visas it grants each month. These are what non-EEA medical staff need to work in the UK. Nurses get priority access to these visas, but there are reports of some doctors being refused them due to government caps.

197,fullfact,"We can't attract junior doctors from around the world because they won’t actually earn enough to meet the minimum income requirements.
","“And because of the quite, quite meaningless limits set on what people can earn, we can't attract junior doctors from around the world because they won’t actually earn enough to meet the minimum income requirements”. Maggie Chapman, 25 January 2018 A junior doctor’s basic salary during their first year is below the minimum required to get the relevant visa to work in the UK—unless they’re aged under 26, in which case the minimum salary is lowered. Junior doctors who’ve completed their first year will usually earn more than the minimum requirements. However, in recent months, the amount junior doctors have needed to earn to be eligible for a visa has been unusually high due to a combination of high demand for visas and the government’s cap on skilled immigration from outside the EU. In December 2017 the threshold was effectively £55,000, and it was £50,000 in January this year—more than is typically earned by a junior doctor at any point. Non-EEA students who graduate from a UK medical school, and then extend their visa to study as a junior doctor, are not subject to these visa requirements. The Scottish Green Party pointed us to these guidelines from the BMA, which explain the salary requirement for doctors on a Tier 2 visa. A Tier 2 (General) visa is required for people from outside the European Economic Area who have been offered a skilled job in the UK. Skilled jobs include “medical practitioners”—the category to which junior doctors belong. A junior doctor is someone who has completed their medical degree and is now in further training, which normally takes 3-8 years. Although they cannot practice medicine independently, they make up almost half of NHS doctors, and could give you diagnosis or put you under anaesthetic. As well as meeting the skills criteria, in order to get a Tier 2 (General) visa an applicant must be paid a minimum of £30,000 a year, or the appropriate salary for their job, whichever is higher. The appropriate salary for a junior doctor (as set out by the Home Office) varies according to which year of training they are in. In the first year of training, the appropriate salary is £26,350—but a first-year junior doctor on a Tier 2 visa would have to earn £30,000. From the second year of training onwards, the appropriate salary for a junior doctor is higher than the £30,000 threshold. Similarly, the NHS says that the basic starting salary for a junior doctor in their first Foundation year is £26,614, rising to £30,805 in the second year. A junior doctor starting specialist training (after a two-year Foundation Programme) has a basic starting salary of £36,461, rising to £46,208. So a non-EEA individual applying to start the two-year Foundation Programme would not be expected to earn enough to be granted a Tier 2 visa. However, those aged under 26 are subject to a reduced earnings threshold of £20,800 if they are sponsored for a Tier 2 (General) visa of no more than 3 years. The Foundation Programme told us that a Tier 2 visa would initially be granted to a Junior Doctor for the 2 years of their foundation training, and they would then extend their visa after applying for specialist training. This means junior doctors under 26 would be eligible for the lower income threshold. Even if we assume they pass the earnings threshold, the limited number of Foundation Programme places available puts another limit on non-EEA junior doctors. Health Education England (HEE) told us that historically the Foundation Programme has been oversubscribed, and they said this means Tier 2 visa applicants would fail the resident labour market test. This test asks the recruiting organisation to first assess whether the “settled workforce” can fill vacant posts, before it offers positions to workers from outside the EU. As the Foundation Programme was oversubscribed, those on Tier 2 visas would not have been considered. However, HEE said that there has been undersubscription over the last two years, meaning that applicants requiring Tier 2 visas would have be considered more recently. But it’s unclear whether these applicants would be able to successfully apply, given the ambiguities about the earnings threshold. The £30,000 threshold has also effectively been inflated by quotas on the number of Tier 2 visas set by the Home Office. Each year the Home Office puts a limit on the number of skilled workers who can come to the UK from outside the EU. These workers need to apply for a visa and have a sponsoring employer in the UK lined up. The employers themselves need to apply to the Home Office beforehand for certificates that allow them to sponsor workers who they want to employ. The Home Office limits this kind of immigration by restricting how many certificates it gives out. In 2017/18, this limit was set at 20,700. Some immigrant workers—such as those earning £160,000 or more—aren’t capped in the same way. Each month a limited number of certificates are allocated. If the number of applications is too high for that month, a points system determines who gets the certificates. So if there are a high number of applications in a single month, the number of points you need is likely to be higher too. In December 2017, around 1,500 certificates for visas were granted, and applicants had to score a minimum of 55 points to make the cut—higher than the usual 21. Points are awarded according to the type of job and salary level of an applicant. In terms of job type, most junior doctors will score 20 points unless there is considered a shortage in their specific occupation. This is the score awarded if an applicant’s proposed employer determines that there is no “settled worker” able to fill their role. That means that in December a junior doctor would have needed to score at least 35 points on the salary scale—so they must have been in line to earn at least £55,000. This is higher than a junior doctor salary at any level. In January 2018 the points score needed was 46. This means that most junior doctors would have to be in line to earn at least £50,000 to get a visa. The other way to score points is if a visa applicant’s proposed job is suffering from a shortage of workers—this is worth 135 points, and so will virtually guarantee making the cut in any given month. Some trainees in emergency medicine and psychiatry are currently included on the shortage occupation list, but all other junior doctors are not (even though the Foundation Programme has been undersubscribed in the past two years). Additional visas may be granted in in “compelling” circumstances such as there being an urgent need for an applicant to begin immediately (for instance to perform life-saving surgery). The number of visas granted for this reason was exceptionally high in December 2017, but we don’t know who they were granted to. Thinking beyond just junior doctors, the government estimates that a third of Tier 2 visas go to the NHS. A spokesperson for Cambridge University Hospitals is reportedas saying that “Cambridge University Hospitals, which is proud to have more than 84 nationalities working at the trust, was disappointed to learn that visas for three overseas doctors due to join us in February have been declined because they do not meet a criteria that includes a salary threshold of £55,000.” We don’t know if any of these individuals were junior doctors. Despite all this, 17% of NHS England junior doctors were non-EEA nationals at the end of September 2017. Based on the full-time equivalent figure it’s 18%. That’s a slightly higher level than the for all NHS England doctors, which is 16% based on both headcount and full-time equivalent. How is this the case if they do not earn enough to enter the Foundation Programme? It’s because non-EEA junior doctors who received their medical degree in the UK are not subject to the same immigration criteria. They can apply to extend their existing Tier 4 visa instead, which is not subject to the same earnings thresholds. Non-EEA students who have completed their studies in the UK will already be on a Tier 4 visa, and they can have their leave to remain extended if they successfully obtain a place on the junior doctor Foundation Programme. The Foundation Programme told us that, over the last five years, an average of 520 doctors a year begin the Foundation Programme on a Tier 4 visa. So the majority of non-EEA junior doctors are likely to be on Tier 4 visas, having completed their medical degrees in the UK. The BMA suggests that it is ""very rare"" for non-EEA individuals to be sponsored for Tier 2 Visa for the junior doctor Foundation Programme. Update 12 February 2018  We've updated this piece with more information from the Foundation Programme on how junior doctors apply for visas. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","A first-year junior doctor typically earns £26,500, rising to £31,000 in their second year. To get a visa, most non-EEA junior doctors usually have to be earning £30,000, or £20,800 if they’re under 26. However, at the end of 2017 the threshold was effectively £55,000.

Health visitor numbers peaked in October 2015 at 10,309. Numbers have fallen by 2,065 or 20% since then.
","“There were 8,244 full time equivalent health visitors working in the NHS as of December 2017, which is the lowest number since August 2013. Numbers peaked at 10,309 in October 2015, meaning there has been a fall of more than 2,065 health visitors or 20% in just over two years”. Labour Party, 19 April 2018 It’s correct there were the equivalent of over 8,200 health visitors working full-time in the NHS in England as of December 2017. It’s also correct that that’s a fall of more than 2,000 health visitors since October 2015. Since NHS workforce numbers tend to vary according to the season, we usually need to compare the same month in each year to see more clearly what the change has been. In this case though the figures are roughly the same when we compare to December 2015. In December 2009 there were just over 8,000 health visitors, and that level remained fairly constant until December 2013, when it started to rise. At around the peak in December 2015, there were about 10,200, meaning numbers have fallen by 19% since then. These numbers are all ‘full-time equivalent’. Full-time equivalent is the number of staff there would be if you added together all their hours to create only full-time jobs. So for example two people working half a week each would add up to one full-time equivalent job.  Health visitors are specially qualified nurses and midwives who work with the community. They mainly work with very young children and their families. They also work with at-risk groups like homeless people, those with addictions and travellers. Responsibility for the commissioning of health visiting services was moved from NHS England to local authorities in 2015. The health think tank King’s Fund has commented on recent dips in the number of nurses and health visitors combined. It says that “The key factor in the fall” is the lower number of nurses from the EU joining the UK nursing register, and an increase in EU staff leaving the NHS. They also note more staff leaving as a result of ill-health and for reasons of work-life balance.","

There are now more nurses from the European Union going home than coming to the UK.
","“If you look at the numbers, it would appear that the big change over the last couple of years has been that we've now got European Union nurses going home rather than coming here… It would seem that part of that apparently, I can't quite believe this, was some new language test was introduced which actually did mean that some people who would otherwise have got in couldn’t get in.” Howard Davies, 18 January 2018 The number of nurses and health visitors from the rest of the EU leaving posts in the English NHS outweighed the number joining in the year to September 2017, the first time this had happened in at least the last five years. Almost 2,800 nurses and health visitors, from the rest of the EU, joined the NHS and just under 4,000 left. These are headcount figures and count the number of individuals rather than full-time equivalent figures which would give an indication of the hours these staff worked. These figures don’t tell us anything about why these nurses left the NHS and we can’t say whether or not they left the UK altogether.

225,fullfact,"Wales has 11% of the UK railway track and gets 1% of investment.
","“We've got 11% of the railway track of the UK in Wales... How much of the government investment do we get? 1%.” Adam Price, 29 November 2019 This doesn’t refer to all investment spending, and seems to be based on data for England and Wales (although comparing to the UK-wide picture may not change very much). Plaid Cymru confirmed to us that Mr Price’s claim is based on a 2018 report for the Welsh Government, by Professor Mark Barry of Cardiff University. The report’s foreword says that the Wales Route “represents 11% of the UK rail network” but has “received just over 1% of rail enhancements…in recent years”. This refers roughly to the period 2011-2016. However, the report itself only looks directly at figures for England and Wales. It estimates the Wales Route makes up about 11% of the route length in England and Wales, and says it gets 1.63% of the spending on “enhancements”. Although out of the whole UK, it’s plausibly closer to 1%. Enhancements refer to things like improving network capability, reliability and capacity, rather than total investment or spending on the Wales Route. Other types of spending outside of enhancements include restoring ageing infrastructure, for which Wales took a bigger share of 6.32%, and day-to-day spending on maintenance and operations (which wouldn’t strictly be counted as “investment”). Wales’ share of total spending is larger than 1%. Using Office of Road and Rail data for 2011-2016, the report says: “Since its inception in 2011 until 2015-16, as a proportion of UK Government investment the Wales Route has received, in cash terms, £1.99bn (~4.37%) out of an England/Wales total of £44bn.” Wales makes up about 5.3% of the England and Wales population, according to the latest estimates.","Wales has about 11% of the rail network in England and Wales. Research suggests it gets 1% of only a subset of investment spending. When you consider other investment spending, Wales gets a higher share.

51,fullfact,"North Wales doesn’t get its fair share of infrastructure spending compared to the rest of the UK.
","“You're not getting what you deserve in infrastructure, not just in rail and transport. You in North Wales do not get your fair share, neither does my area.” John Mann MP, 14 June 2018 We don’t know exactly who in the UK gets what out of infrastructure spending. There are two key reasons why: the available data is very bad at answering this sort of question, and for most projects it’s not possible to single out who benefits. A lot of projects benefit people across the UK, others across several connected regions, like a long-distance railway for example. The main published data also doesn’t include all spending by devolved governments, so it’s even more difficult to do comparisons outside of England. We’ve covered the caveats on infrastructure spending before. For now, here’s what we can say from the available figures. Of projects allocated to specific regions, London and the North West currently receive more spending per head than other parts of England. The government calculates that, comparing English regions, London is set to get around £2,500 per head from central and local government from 2017/18 to 2020/21, just counting funding that could be allocated to a specific place. The London figure includes spending by Transport for London, so the comparisons aren’t very accurate. The North West is similar at £2,300 per head, while the North East and Yorkshire are behind at around £1,300. John Mann represents a constituency in the East Midlands, which does get relatively little funding per head from central and local government: about £1,400. Other spending comes from private companies, which doesn’t change the picture hugely (the South West gets a huge bump in private funding from the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station project—though that’s also an example of a project which will be felt beyond the region it’s allocated to). Wales overall gets much less per head from central government, with North Wales taking most of that from a single construction project. But that leaves out all the money from the Welsh government. Separate figures from the Welsh government suggests it plans to fund around £6.5 billion on projects currently in the pipeline. Not all of those have necessarily started yet. One example is the biggest single project listed: a new M4 Corridor around Newport, in South Wales, due to start construction at the end of this year. It’s much more difficult to pinpoint projects that go specifically to North Wales, and how that translates per head. As a very rough guide, and factoring in the devolved funding, Wales as a whole is on a better footing than most English regions but still some way behind London and the North West, in terms of their public infrastructure spending per head. The Welsh government told us that while Welsh and UK infrastructure spending figures aren’t directly comparable, the types of project and the information they hold is broadly similar. It said better figures were provided by the Treasury on spending comparisons per head between UK regions, although this only gives current funding for projects and not expected future financing.   Update 27 June 2018  We've added information about how comparable English and Welsh infrastructure spending figures are, provided by the Welsh government. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","It’s not possible to say from available data. Specifying who benefits from infrastructure projects is often neither fair nor possible to do.

118,fullfact,"The Express used a photo from before coronavirus lockdown to suggest people in Brighton were breaking social distancing rules.
","A tweet claimed that the Daily Express used an old photo of Brighton and Hove seafront, from before the coronavirus outbreak, on a front-page story about people failing to social distance during lockdown. An image of the tweet has also been shared on Facebook.  However, this claim is incorrect. The photo editor behind the story shared the photo’s metadata and a copy of the file to Twitter to prove it had been taken in April 2020, during the lockdown. The metadata suggests it was taken at 5:53pm on 23 April 2020. They also shared evidence indicating that several supposed inconsistencies in the photograph—such as the cranes in the background, or the length of shadows— were in fact authentic. A picture from a webcam at a nearby business taken less than an hour later shows what appear to be the same vehicles seen in the photograph in the same position. Some people commenting on Twitter also suggested the photo had been taken or cropped in a way to make visitors to the seafront seem closer together. We have written before about how some authentic photos of crowds can still be potentially misleading when using long telephoto lenses, by making the crowds appear denser. In this case, the metadata indicates the picture was taken with an iPhone 11 Pro’s zoom lens, which suggests that effect could play a slight, but limited, role—far less than could be achieved with a professional telephoto lens.     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as false        because metadata shows that the photo was taken during lockdown.    ","This is incorrect.

111,fullfact,"Mr Starmer explains in a clip why child grooming gangs weren’t prosecuted.
","A now-deleted tweet with a clip of Labour party leader Keir Starmer talking about prosecuting child sexual abuse has been shared across Twitter, including by several MPs. The text on the tweet argues that the clip shows Mr Starmer being dismissive towards victims of grooming. You can see another tweet containing the clip here.  Several MPs have now deleted their tweets. The clip removes the context from an interview with Mr Starmer.     The clip comes from an interview with 5 News in 2013 when he was the Director of Public Prosecutions. The full interview can be watched here. The interview was regarding new guidelines, published at the time, around the handling of child sexual abuse cases.  The tweets suggested that Mr Starmer had not prosecuted child grooming gangs at the time because children didn’t usually report the abuse straight away, because the children had been in trouble before, and because they had used drugs or alcohol.Mr Starmer is not talking about this in the interview. He is addressing how previous guidelines around how prosecutors should deal with allegations of child sexual abuse took the wrong approach and how they are being reformed, rather than giving reasons why specific gangs weren’t prosecuted.  The transcript of the interview can be read below.  Interviewer: “Just how much of an acknowledgement is this that the methods you have been using up until now, just have been really in the wrong mindset and so misguided? Keir Starmer: These guidelines are a recognition that the approach that has been taken in the past was the wrong approach. It was based on a number of assumptions which don’t withstand scrutiny, the guidelines change that, and they require the police and prosecutors to focus intensely on the allegation actually being made and not so much on the weaknesses and vulnerabilities that are invariably there in some of the victims that come forward. I: Could you just expand a little on what you mean by the kind of things that were going wrong, just give us some obvious examples of how the previous guidelines weren’t really up to standard? KS: The assumptions that were made included the assumption that a victim of child sexual abuse will swiftly report what happened to them to the police, will be able to give a coherent and consistent account first time, that they will not themselves have engaged in any offending or other behaviour, and that they will not have misused drugs or alcohol at any stage. Those assumptions do not withstand scrutiny, they’ve got to change, the guidelines make that clear, and so this is a clear break with the past. “","This is incorrect. The clip is from an interview with Mr Starmer on changes to how police and prosecutors deal with victims of child sexual abuse, rather than a discussion of why specific gangs weren’t prosecuted.

122,fullfact,"In Wales you cannot sit in the park on a bench.
","A post on Facebook with over 10,000 shares makes a number of claims about lockdown rules in Wales. The post was shared after Boris Johnson’s televised address on Sunday 10 May. “It doesn't matter what Boris Johnson has just said, it DOES NOT apply to you in Wales. You CANNOT sit in the park on a bench , you CANNOT drive to your place of exercise. WALES stays the same as before for another 3 weeks. You must exercise near your home more than once a day if you so wish ONLY with members of your household. You must stay home unless absolutely necessary. Wales regulations are not permitting you to jump in your car to visit places other than shopping for essentials, helping someone who is shielding, or to work.” Facebook user, 10 May 2020 It’s correct that Boris Johnson’s statement on easing lockdown applied to England only, and the Facebook post’s claims about what is allowed in Wales are partly correct at the time of writing. “You CANNOT sit in the park on a bench , you CANNOT drive to your place of exercise. WALES stays the same as before for another 3 weeks. You must exercise near your home more than once a day if you so wish ONLY with members of your household.” The Welsh guidance currently says: “Going for a walk and also stopping to have something to eat or sit in a park, for example, is intended to be permitted. Most of the time away from home should, however, be spent exercising.” When the Facebook post was first shared, on Sunday 10 May, the guidance for Wales was slightly different and said: “Going for a walk and then having a picnic or spending a prolonged period on a park bench, for example, is not considered to be exercise and is not intended to be a reasonable excuse.” The Welsh government has said that the lockdown in Wales will be extended for another three weeks with “minor adjustments”. These changes were that people could exercise more than once a day and that certain garden centres would be allowed to open.  And it’s true that in Wales exercise must still start and end at home, so you cannot drive to a location to exercise, though there are exceptions for some people for whom this isn’t possible. On 8 May, the Welsh government announced that from Monday 11 May, people would be allowed to exercise more than once a day, but that “exercise should start and end at home and not involve going a significant distance from home.” This has not changed since lockdown in Wales began. Also, the post claims that in Wales you can exercise only with members of your household. This is correct. By comparison, in England, Boris Johnson has said that from Wednesday 13 May, people may “sit in the sun in your local park” and “drive to other destinations”. Further guidance published the day after his televised address said you can “sit and rest outside” and “drive to outdoor publicly accessible open spaces irrespective of distance”. It adds that the public should check whether these places are open before they travel. The guidance also clarified that you can also exercise or spend time outside with one person who is not in your household, as long as you stay two metres apart at all times. For England, from Wednesday 13 May, people may take unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise, with members of their household.  The post also says: “Wales regulations are not permitting you to jump in your car to visit places other than shopping for essentials, helping someone who is shielding, or to work.” This is basically correct. The law in Wales, as in England, says you should not leave your home without a “reasonable excuse”. Shopping for essentials, helping the vulnerable and travelling to work are among the reasonable excuses listed, though there are other reasons given such as escaping the risk of harm. There’s nothing that says you can’t use a car to do these things.  The Welsh government has specified that garden centres will be allowed to open from Monday 11 May, if they have social distancing measures in place, so you will presumably be allowed to drive to these as a customer if they are open. In England, from 13 May, the government says “Day trips to outdoor open space, in a private vehicle, are permitted”. It also adds you shouldn’t use a car with anyone who is not a member of your household. The Institute for Government says: “the UK government can only change the ‘lockdown’ regulations in England.” “The respective devolved governments are responsible for making any changes to the rules on social distancing in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (for example, to allow for exercise more than once a day).”     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as true        because the rules on lockdown are slightly different for Wales, the claims in the post were basically correct when the post was shared and the situation has only changed slightly since then.    ","When the Facebook post the claim is from was shared the Welsh government said you shouldn’t spend a prolonged period on a park bench. This guidance has now changed slightly and says it’s okay to be out for a walk in a park and to stop to sit down so long as you spend most of the time out of the house exercising.

The law in Wales, as in England, says you should not leave your home without a “reasonable excuse”. Shopping for essentials, helping the vulnerable and travelling to work are among the reasonable excuses listed, though there are other reasons given such as escaping the risk of harm. There’s nothing that says you can’t use a car to do these things.  The Welsh government has specified that garden centres will be allowed to open from Monday 11 May, if they have social distancing measures in place, so you will presumably be allowed to drive to these as a customer if they are open. In England, from 13 May, the government says “Day trips to outdoor open space, in a private vehicle, are permitted”. It also adds you shouldn’t use a car with anyone who is not a member of your household. The Institute for Government says: “the UK government can only change the ‘lockdown’ regulations in England.” “The respective devolved governments are responsible for making any changes to the rules on social distancing in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (for example, to allow for exercise more than once a day).”     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

Asking what’s in the vaccine before having it is classed as an offence.
","A number of posts on Facebook have claimed that the laws in the UK have been changed because of Covid-19 so that you can be forcibly vaccinated and that it is an offence to ask what’s in the vaccine. A YouTube video has also made similar claims, which was shared by Katie Hopkins. The video claims that the law changed from 27 April. “THE U.K. LAWS CHANGED YESTERDAY - 27 APRIL 2020 ALL OF OUR HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN STRIPPED AWAY. The Control of Diseases Act changed yesterday, 27 April 2020 with immediate effect. You WILL be forceably vaccinated Doctor patient confidentiality is no longer and you can be detained, all your belongings ceased, your family members detained. Even by asking what’s in the vaccine before having it, is classed as an offence.  IF this vaccine was safe, why would they change the laws to enforce it?”  Facebook user, 29 April 2020 “Just to let you know that the first thing that’ll strike you when you look up this act on the government website is that it says changes to legislation, and this has been updated on the 27th April 2020. So just a day or so ago. And it’s come into force on that day. So this is applicable from now.” Youtube video, 28 April 2020 It’s not correct that the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 was amended on 27 April. It’s not true that this law says you can be forcibly vaccinated either. The 1984 law specifies that you can’t be forced to have medical treatment, which includes a vaccine, but the law does give magistrates the power to prevent the spread of the disease in other ways, like forcing people to isolate themselves. The National Archives, which manages the online legislation database, told us that it was not true that the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 was amended on 27 April.  At the time of writing, the last time this legislation was amended was on 25 March, which happened as a result of the Coronavirus 2020 Act. This change didn’t add anything to the 1984 act but meant that a part of it would temporarily no longer apply. The part that was changed was section 46(3). Up to 25 March, local authorities were not allowed to arrange for a cremation against the wishes of the deceased. The House of Commons Library says that “Under the new powers, this would be suspended. However, the Government has stated that personal choice for body disposal will be respected as far as possible.” The government has said it’s extremely unlikely that a deceased person’s preferences on burial would not be adhered to, and the legislation says local authorities must take the person’s wishes into account. There are a number of things the law allows to prevent the spread of a disease. Forcing people to have medical treatment is not one of them. And the law specifies that by treatment, it “includes vaccination and other prophylactic treatment”. Prophylactic means something to prevent the disease. So this law does not mean you can be forced to have a vaccination (or treatment). Lawyer, Louise Hooper of Garden Court Chambers writes in a blog post: “The Act makes explicitly clear that the power to make such regulations does not include mandatory treatment or vaccination.”  The law mentions nothing about people not being allowed to ask what’s in a vaccine. The government’s own guidelines on vaccinations more generally says individuals “must be given enough information to enable them to make a decision before they can give consent.” Some of the claims in the post, about what you can be forced to do if suspected of having the disease and being able to infect others, are about right. This legislation says that a person suspected of being infectious can “be kept in isolation or quarantine”, can be taken to or detained in hospital, has to answer questions about their health, and that their health may be monitored and the results of this reported. It also says objects can be seized if they are suspected of being infected or contaminated. The posts also claim that your family can be detained. The law doesn’t mention family specifically, but says that a suspected infected person may have to answer questions about whether a “related party” might be infected, and a magistrate could make the same orders as mentioned above on them. It seems as though the person in the YouTube video misunderstood the green bar at the top of the webpage of the legislation. They refer to “changes to legislation” which at the time of writing says the legislation is “up to date with all changes known to be in force on or before 05 May 2020.” That doesn’t mean legislation was changed on 5 May, but that all changes made up until 5 May are reflected in the document. The date in this box, which presumably was 27 April when the person read it, is the last date the website could guarantee the law was in force exactly as it appeared on the site.      This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as partly false        because the law didn’t change to say people could be forcibly vaccinated but some of the claims, about being forced to isolate, are true.

This change didn’t add anything to the 1984 act but meant that a part of it would temporarily no longer apply. The part that was changed was section 46(3). Up to 25 March, local authorities were not allowed to arrange for a cremation against the wishes of the deceased. The House of Commons Library says that “Under the new powers, this would be suspended.

It also says objects can be seized if they are suspected of being infected or contaminated. The posts also claim that your family can be detained. The law doesn’t mention family specifically, but says that a suspected infected person may have to answer questions about whether a “related party” might be infected, and a magistrate could make the same orders as mentioned above on them.

Your belongings can be seized.
","A number of posts on Facebook have claimed that the laws in the UK have been changed because of Covid-19 so that you can be forcibly vaccinated and that it is an offence to ask what’s in the vaccine. A YouTube video has also made similar claims, which was shared by Katie Hopkins. The video claims that the law changed from 27 April. “THE U.K. LAWS CHANGED YESTERDAY - 27 APRIL 2020 ALL OF OUR HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN STRIPPED AWAY. The Control of Diseases Act changed yesterday, 27 April 2020 with immediate effect. You WILL be forceably vaccinated Doctor patient confidentiality is no longer and you can be detained, all your belongings ceased, your family members detained. Even by asking what’s in the vaccine before having it, is classed as an offence.  IF this vaccine was safe, why would they change the laws to enforce it?”  Facebook user, 29 April 2020 “Just to let you know that the first thing that’ll strike you when you look up this act on the government website is that it says changes to legislation, and this has been updated on the 27th April 2020. So just a day or so ago. And it’s come into force on that day. So this is applicable from now.” Youtube video, 28 April 2020 It’s not correct that the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 was amended on 27 April. It’s not true that this law says you can be forcibly vaccinated either. The 1984 law specifies that you can’t be forced to have medical treatment, which includes a vaccine, but the law does give magistrates the power to prevent the spread of the disease in other ways, like forcing people to isolate themselves. The National Archives, which manages the online legislation database, told us that it was not true that the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 was amended on 27 April.  At the time of writing, the last time this legislation was amended was on 25 March, which happened as a result of the Coronavirus 2020 Act. This change didn’t add anything to the 1984 act but meant that a part of it would temporarily no longer apply. The part that was changed was section 46(3). Up to 25 March, local authorities were not allowed to arrange for a cremation against the wishes of the deceased. The House of Commons Library says that “Under the new powers, this would be suspended. However, the Government has stated that personal choice for body disposal will be respected as far as possible.” The government has said it’s extremely unlikely that a deceased person’s preferences on burial would not be adhered to, and the legislation says local authorities must take the person’s wishes into account. There are a number of things the law allows to prevent the spread of a disease. Forcing people to have medical treatment is not one of them. And the law specifies that by treatment, it “includes vaccination and other prophylactic treatment”. Prophylactic means something to prevent the disease. So this law does not mean you can be forced to have a vaccination (or treatment). Lawyer, Louise Hooper of Garden Court Chambers writes in a blog post: “The Act makes explicitly clear that the power to make such regulations does not include mandatory treatment or vaccination.”  The law mentions nothing about people not being allowed to ask what’s in a vaccine. The government’s own guidelines on vaccinations more generally says individuals “must be given enough information to enable them to make a decision before they can give consent.” Some of the claims in the post, about what you can be forced to do if suspected of having the disease and being able to infect others, are about right. This legislation says that a person suspected of being infectious can “be kept in isolation or quarantine”, can be taken to or detained in hospital, has to answer questions about their health, and that their health may be monitored and the results of this reported. It also says objects can be seized if they are suspected of being infected or contaminated. The posts also claim that your family can be detained. The law doesn’t mention family specifically, but says that a suspected infected person may have to answer questions about whether a “related party” might be infected, and a magistrate could make the same orders as mentioned above on them. It seems as though the person in the YouTube video misunderstood the green bar at the top of the webpage of the legislation. They refer to “changes to legislation” which at the time of writing says the legislation is “up to date with all changes known to be in force on or before 05 May 2020.” That doesn’t mean legislation was changed on 5 May, but that all changes made up until 5 May are reflected in the document.

You can be isolated if it’s suspected you have an infectious disease, and your family members, if it’s suspected you’ve infected them, can also be subjected to these measures.

Violent incidents rose to 31,025, up 16%, of which 9,003 were on staff, which is up by a quarter in the year to March 2018.
","“More than 46,850 self-harm incidents were recorded in the year to March 2018, up by 16 per cent on the previous year, with self-harm now recorded on average 128 times a day.” “Violent incidents meanwhile rose to 31,025, up 16 per cent, and of which 9,003 were assaults on staff – a figure that has soared by more than a quarter (26 per cent) in the 12 months to March.” The Independent, 26 July 2018 “The amount of times drugs were found in prisons across England and Wales rose by 23% in one year, Ministry of Justice figures reveal…” “The figures for the year between March 2017 and March 2018 also reveal that 20.4% of drug tests came back as positive.” Sky News, 26 July 2018 Assaults of all types and self-harm incidents are up in prisons, as are positive drug tests, and the number of times drugs have been found. There were just under 83,000 people in prisons in England and Wales at the start of August 2018. The Ministry of Justice aims to randomly drug test 5% or 10% of prisoners in each prison every month. Around 54,400 tests were administered in 2017/18. 11% of the results proved positive for “traditional drugs”, like cannabis, opiates, cocaine and methadone. Positive tests for traditional drugs have risen slightly from 9% in 2016/17. This latest year had the highest proportion of positive results since 2004/5 when 11.8% were positive.  If you include positive results for psychoactive substances, like ‘Spice’, 20% of them were positive. This is the first year the psychoactive test results have been published so we can’t compare that 20% figure over time. The most common positive test result in 2017/18 was for psychoactive substances—60% of positive samples contained them. Second was cannabis, at 28%. Some test results were positive for multiple substances. The random drug tests are mandatory—although a prisoner can refuse to take it and face a disciplinary procedure. Failing the test is a disciplinary offence, which could mean a longer sentence. The number of times drugs have been found in prisons has increased over the last five years. There were 13,100 incidents where drugs were found in prisons in 2017/18, up 23% on the year before when there were around 10,700. That figure’s been increasing since 2012/13 when drugs were found just under 4,300 times. Psychoactive substances were also the type of drug found most often. There were 31,000 assault incidents in prisons and state-run immigration removal centres in the year to March 2018. 22,400 of these were prisoner-on-prisoner assaults and 9,000 were assaults on staff. There were 364 total assaults per thousand prisoners in 2017/18. That’s roughly the same as the number per thousand male prisoners, though for women (who make up about 5% of the prison population) it’s slightly lower. There were 46 per thousand prisoners, of what the Ministry of Justice classes as “serious assaults”. This includes sexual assault, anything that results in being an inpatient at a hospital, concussion and other specific types of injury like broken noses and lost teeth. For prisoner-on-prisoner assaults, there were 262 per thousand, and 106 assaults on staff per thousand prisoners.  The Ministry of Justice changed how assaults were recorded in April 2017. It said this simplified how incidents involving staff are identified but it “is possible this has increased the recording of incidents”. There were 46,900 incidents of self-harm recorded in prisons in England and Wales in 2017/18, up 16% on the year before. Per day, that works out as 128 incidents. This is the highest it’s been over the last ten years, when this data series began. Self-harm is defined as “any act where a prisoner deliberately harms themselves, irrespective of the method, intent or severity of any injury”. The figures may include some but not necessarily all attempts at suicide. There were around 11,900 “self-harming individuals” in prisons overall. Again, looking at incidents per thousand there were 549 incidents of self-harm per thousand prisoners in 2017/18 in prisons overall. Female prisoners have long been more likely to self-harm, and more often than those in male prisoners. There were 467 self-harm incidents per thousand male prisoners in 2017/18.

Correct. Assaults on staff were up a quarter from around 7,160 to 9,000.

The amount of times drugs were found in prisons across England and Wales rose by 23% in one year. 20.4% of drug tests came back as positive.
","“More than 46,850 self-harm incidents were recorded in the year to March 2018, up by 16 per cent on the previous year, with self-harm now recorded on average 128 times a day.” “Violent incidents meanwhile rose to 31,025, up 16 per cent, and of which 9,003 were assaults on staff – a figure that has soared by more than a quarter (26 per cent) in the 12 months to March.” The Independent, 26 July 2018 “The amount of times drugs were found in prisons across England and Wales rose by 23% in one year, Ministry of Justice figures reveal…” “The figures for the year between March 2017 and March 2018 also reveal that 20.4% of drug tests came back as positive.” Sky News, 26 July 2018 Assaults of all types and self-harm incidents are up in prisons, as are positive drug tests, and the number of times drugs have been found. There were just under 83,000 people in prisons in England and Wales at the start of August 2018. The Ministry of Justice aims to randomly drug test 5% or 10% of prisoners in each prison every month. Around 54,400 tests were administered in 2017/18. 11% of the results proved positive for “traditional drugs”, like cannabis, opiates, cocaine and methadone. Positive tests for traditional drugs have risen slightly from 9% in 2016/17. This latest year had the highest proportion of positive results since 2004/5 when 11.8% were positive.  If you include positive results for psychoactive substances, like ‘Spice’, 20% of them were positive. This is the first year the psychoactive test results have been published so we can’t compare that 20% figure over time. The most common positive test result in 2017/18 was for psychoactive substances—60% of positive samples contained them. Second was cannabis, at 28%. Some test results were positive for multiple substances. The random drug tests are mandatory—although a prisoner can refuse to take it and face a disciplinary procedure. Failing the test is a disciplinary offence, which could mean a longer sentence. The number of times drugs have been found in prisons has increased over the last five years. There were 13,100 incidents where drugs were found in prisons in 2017/18, up 23% on the year before when there were around 10,700. That figure’s been increasing since 2012/13 when drugs were found just under 4,300 times. Psychoactive substances were also the type of drug found most often. There were 31,000 assault incidents in prisons and state-run immigration removal centres in the year to March 2018. 22,400 of these were prisoner-on-prisoner assaults and 9,000 were assaults on staff. There were 364 total assaults per thousand prisoners in 2017/18. That’s roughly the same as the number per thousand male prisoners, though for women (who make up about 5% of the prison population) it’s slightly lower. There were 46 per thousand prisoners, of what the Ministry of Justice classes as “serious assaults”. This includes sexual assault, anything that results in being an inpatient at a hospital, concussion and other specific types of injury like broken noses and lost teeth. For prisoner-on-prisoner assaults, there were 262 per thousand, and 106 assaults on staff per thousand prisoners.  The Ministry of Justice changed how assaults were recorded in April 2017. It said this simplified how incidents involving staff are identified but it “is possible this has increased the recording of incidents”. There were 46,900 incidents of self-harm recorded in prisons in England and Wales in 2017/18, up 16% on the year before. Per day, that works out as 128 incidents. This is the highest it’s been over the last ten years, when this data series began. Self-harm is defined as “any act where a prisoner deliberately harms themselves, irrespective of the method, intent or severity of any injury”. The figures may include some but not necessarily all attempts at suicide. There were around 11,900 “self-harming individuals” in prisons overall. Again, looking at incidents per thousand there were 549 incidents of self-harm per thousand prisoners in 2017/18 in prisons overall. Female prisoners have long been more likely to self-harm, and more often than those in male prisoners. There were 467 self-harm incidents per thousand male prisoners in 2017/18. For women, this figures was just over 2,200. There were 308 self-harming women per thousand female prisoners in 2017/18. ","

247,fullfact,"If you are in the UK and under coronavirus lockdown with an abusive partner dial 999, wait to be connected, press 55 & hang up.
","We’ve seen a number of tweets in recent days from journalists, charities and politicians which recommend that people calling the police due to domestic abuse who cannot speak on the phone as they’re in lockdown with their abuser should call 999, dial 55 when someone answers and then hang up. This is similar to claims we’ve come across in the past which said that dialling 55 would allow the police to track your location. Neither of these are correct. Typing 55 on a 999 call from a mobile when prompted is a way to alert the automated system that you need police assistance. You should not hang up as soon as you do this though. If you need to call 999 for any reason the first person you will speak to is a BT operator—they will direct your call to the relevant emergency service.  In some circumstances it may not be possible or safe for you to speak to the operator. Your call should still be transferred to the police by the operator if they hear suspicious noises, and you can also cough, tap the handset or make a noise to alert them.   If the call is silent and done from a mobile phone (not a landline), it will be forwarded to an automated system called “Silent Solution”.  An automated voice asks the caller to press 55 if they need police assistance. You can listen to what happens on one of these calls here. This will also direct the call to a police call handler. The Independent Office for Police Conduct, which ran a campaign about Silent Solution last year, told us that people should not dial 55 then hang up. It said: “The Silent Solution system is used to filter out the many accidental or hoax 999 calls every day. If you press 55, when prompted, you are making it known it is a genuine emergency but you cannot speak. The BT call handler will then transfer you to the police.”  The police will then ask a series of questions to try and get some more details about the situation. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) told us that “Call handlers are highly trained to seek details from callers who may not be in a position to speak and so can use methods like tapping the handset or asking questions requiring only a yes or no answer.” As we’ve said before, dialling 55 doesn’t necessarily allow the police to determine your location. The NPCC also said “Police will not always send officers to silent calls so it is important for callers to try and provide as much information as they can – in any way they can.” Silent Solution is not used on calls from landlines as, according to the NPCC, “it’s less likely that 999 calls are made by accident from landlines”. The Independent Office of Police Conduct says that on calls from landlines: “if there is no request for an emergency, the caller does not answer questions, and only background noise can be heard and BT operators cannot decide whether an emergency service is needed” then they will transfer the call to the police.  The guidance also says that if for any reason you disconnect the call on a landline by hanging up you have 45 seconds to pick it up again and the call will resume. If this happens (you hang up and pick up again within 45 seconds) the BT call handler will also forward the call to the police.","You will only be prompted to press 55 on a silent call from a mobile. And you should not hang up after typing 55. You should try and cough, tap the handset or whisper to communicate on an emergency call if possible.

248,fullfact,"A government review warns it is almost as easy to buy some drugs as it is to buy pizza.
","“Drugs are so widely available they are as easy to buy as pizzas, reveals government review.” The Telegraph, 27 February 2020 “Getting drugs in Britain almost easier than ordering pizza, study warns.” The Daily Star, 27 February 2020 There is not enough evidence to back up the claim that it is as easy to buy some drugs as it is to buy a pizza.   Launching phase one of a Home Office review into drug use at the UK Drugs Summit in Glasgow on 27 February, Dame Carol Black warned of the “abundant supply” of drugs coming into the UK saying: “It’s purer, it’s more available, you can buy whichever drug you want almost anywhere. “It wouldn’t be too far to go to say it’s almost for some drugs as easy as getting your pizza.” Multiple news outlets ran stories based on Dame Carol’s comments , with some  —The Telegraph and The Daily Star—incorrectly attributing them to the review itself, which was published on 28 February. Dame Carol confirmed to Full Fact that she was referring to the comparative delivery times of pizza and drugs, both of which she said can be delivered in around 30 minutes.   After asking for clarification on where this data came from, Full Fact was pointed to a study into crack cocaine use, published in March last year by the Home Office and Public Health England, which interviewed drug treatment workers, service users and police officers. The study said these groups all agreed crack was “more widely available” now than it had been in the past and described the fast delivery as “quicker than a pizza”, although it seems based on anecdotal evidence and made no mention of 30 minutes delivery time. Data on the relative delivery times of cocaine and pizza orders has previously been collected by the Global Drug Survey. The survey most recently collected this data in 2018, when it asked 15,000 cocaine users around the world whether they could get cocaine delivered in under 30 minutes, and whether they could get a pizza delivered in the same time. This sounds similar to the figures provided to us by Dame Carol, but they don’t break down to a UK-only level. The global results revealed 30% could get cocaine in 30 minutes or less, while just 16.5% said the same about pizza. In the UK, 83% of respondents said they could get cocaine on the day it was ordered, with 37% saying it would be delivered in 30 minutes or less. However, the survey did not break down pizza delivery-time by country, so no specific UK comparison can be done. We’ve looked at this before. The 2019 Global Drug Survey found that, internationally, 61.7% of cocaine-using participants had cocaine delivered on the same day and 30% of those reported waiting no more than 30 minutes, but it did not collect data on pizza. The report said: “We also look at speed for delivery and update our work from last year – though we won’t be mentioning pizzas for a while.” Professor Adam Winstock, founder and CEO of the Global Drug Survey, told Full Fact the organisation had decided not to compare to pizza again as there are “other things to focus on that we consider more important than pizza to address our primary mission of reducing drug-related harm—more important than pizza headlines.” No other comparisons between pizza and drug delivery have been done that we’re aware of. Without any updated figures, or specific break-downs about pizza delivery time in the UK, there is not enough evidence to show that it is as easy to get some drugs as it is to get pizza.","There is not enough evidence for this claim, which does not appear in the review itself. The Global Drug Survey compared delivery times of cocaine and pizza internationally in 2018 and found 30% of people could get cocaine in under 30 minutes while only 16.5% of people said they could get a pizza delivered in that time. Figures to make this comparison for the UK aren’t available.

","“Criminals sent to jail only after 55 offences” “93: The number of crimes one offender carried out last year before going to jail for the first time” i news (print edition), 20 February 2020 i news has reported on the number of offences previously committed by people in prison in England and Wales.

They may have received a conviction —which could lead to prison sentence—or a caution. The FOI data i news uses in the article shows that women given a prison sentence of up to six months had committed, on average, 60.5 previous offences and men had committed 56.6 offences. For people sentenced for longer periods, the number of previous offences was lower. For example women receiving life imprisonment had committed, on average, 18.1 prior offences. For men it was 19.9. Even just focusing on people given a sentence of up to six months, the data may overstate the prevalence of reoffending, as people may be counted more than once in the figures. For example, someone sent to prison four times over the course of a year (and whom one might expect to have a larger number of previous offences) would be counted four times in the data, compared to someone sent to prison once (who may have committed a smaller number of offences).

229,fullfact,"There has been a 400% increase in hate crime within the LGBT+ community.
","“We’ve had nearly a 400% increase in hate crime with the LGBT+ community” Dawn Butler MP, 17 February 2020 Speaking on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Dawn Butler, the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, said that hate crimes against members of the LGBT+ community has increased by almost 400%. We’ve contacted Dawn Butler for more information about this claim but it doesn’t seem correct. The number of sexual orientation and transgender hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales increased by 261% between 2011/12 and 2018/19, not by 400%. However, another source of hate crime data, the Crime Survey for England and Wales, estimates that sexual orientation hate crime has actually decreased by 40% over roughly this period. The Crime Survey aims to gauge the total level of crime, whether reported to and recorded by the police, or not. Neither of these measurements is perfect, and so neither gives a full picture of hate crime across England and Wales. Hate crimes recorded by the police The Home Office publishes the number of hate crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales. These figures are published separately by ‘hate crime strand’. Two of these categories are sexual orientation and transgender identity. We are presuming that Dawn Butler was referring to both of these types of hate crime. We don’t know the time period Ms Butler was referring to, but have looked at the largest increase in hate crime records, from 2011/12, when comparable recording started, and the latest data.   The number of recorded sexual orientation hate crimes increased from 4,345 in 2011/12 to 14,491 in 2018/19: a 234% increase. Over the same period the number of recorded transgender hate crimes increased by 645%, from 313 to 2,333. When both types of hate crime are combined, there was a 261% increase in the number of these crimes recorded by the police between 2011/12 and 2018/19. However, there are problems with the measurement of hate crime, which we have written about before. As stated by the Home Office, “increases in hate crime over the last five years have been mainly driven by improvements in crime recording by the police”. The Crime Survey for England and Wales The other source of hate crime statistics is the Crime Survey for England and Wales. This is a face-to-face population survey that collects information on all perceived victimisation, not just that reported to the police. Numbers of incidents are combined over several years to make the results more reliable. The rates of incidents in the survey are then multiplied by population estimates for England and Wales to get a population-level number of crimes. As so few people in the survey report gender identity hate crime, there is no estimate given for this type of crime. However, this is unlikely to have a significant effect on the change in this estimate of LGBT+ hate crimes, as the reported figures are so small. This survey estimated that there were 42,000 incidents of sexual orientation hate crime per year between 2009/10 and 2011/12 decreasing to 30,000 per year between 2015/16 and 2017/18 (using combined-year statistics). This is an estimated 40% decrease over roughly the same period as covered by the police records. As with police records, crime survey data also isn’t perfect. The survey’s data doesn’t include, for example, crimes against children under 16, which is captured in police data.","Incorrect. There are two sources of data on this type of hate crime. One estimates a 261% increase in hate crime on the basis of sexual orientation and transgender identity, and the other estimates a 40% decrease in hate crimes based on sexual orientation since around 2010. Neither measure is perfect.

230,fullfact,"Fewer knife crime offenders are facing jail.
","“There is no evidence in this data that the government’s new approach to tackling knife crime is having a positive effect. The number of offences is rising while fewer offenders are facing jail”. Diane Abbott, 16 January 2020 New figures on sentencing for certain types of knife crime were released this week, prompting the shadow home secretary Diane Abbott to criticise the government, saying that the number of offenders is rising while fewer offenders are going to jail. The number of these offences that are dealt with in the criminal justice system is rising, but it’s probably not correct that fewer offenders are facing jail. In fact it’s highly likely that more are, and a greater proportion of offenders are. Ms Abbott is using figures that don’t show the full extent of prison sentences that offenders will face. Labour put out a press release featuring figures from the Ministry of Justice showing that the actual number of people sentenced to prison fell from 8,050 in the year ending September 2018, to 7,728 in the same period in 2019. These aren’t figures for all crimes that involve a knife—assaults and murders, for example, are counted separately and flagged as involving knives. The figures Labour is reporting cover possessing knives or offensive weapons (other dangerous weapons not including firearms) in public or threatening or endangering people in public. That 7,728 figure is provisional—it doesn’t include offences which happened in that year but haven’t finished going through the justice system. Many will take several months to reach the sentencing stage. The Ministry of Justice estimates this number will eventually reach 8,384 offenders—slightly higher than the 8,050 the previous year. So it’s misleading for Labour to compare the actual number of offenders going to prison in 2018 and 2019, because 2019 figures are incomplete and will end up being higher. Labour should be comparing the 2018 figure with the estimated number for 2019, which will show the truer trend.  As has been reported widely, the comparable estimates indicate that offenders are more likely to face prison, with 38% estimated to do so last year compared to 23% back in 2009. That rate has been growing year-on-year. Sentencing policy on knife crime possession has become stricter over the last decade, with a number of laws, judgements and guidance issued making it more likely that offenders receive prison sentences for longer. It’s also worth noting that the increase in offences may partly reflect a greater use of stop and search powers unearthing knives people are carrying, rather than just more people carrying knives. We don’t seek to comment in this piece on the wider question of whether the government’s policies are having a “positive effect”.","This is very likely to be wrong.

This survey covers households in England and Wales and so does not cover groups (such as those living in student halls of residence), who have “potentially high proportions of drug use”, meaning the true figure could be higher.

Incorrect. This is a typo from a claim made in 2008 which said 4 square metres not kilometres of rainforest are destroyed for every gram of cocaine. This estimate doesn’t appear to be true in 2016.

232,fullfact,"More than 30,000 children aged between 10 and 15 now say that they are in gangs.
","“More than 30,000 children aged between 10 and 15 now say that they are in gangs, according to research that will fuel concerns about the country’s violent crime epidemic.” The Times, 25 June 2018 The 30,000 estimate has significant limitations, and cannot be fairly used to draw a link to a supposed rising crime epidemic. The figure of 30,000 children comes from the Office of the Children’s Commissioner. It produced this estimate in a 2017 study, using data from 2013/14 from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which reported that 0.9% of 10-15 year olds it surveyed in England and Wales described themselves as being in a street gang. But this figure is subject to significant uncertainty, as The Office of the Children’s Commissioner noted at the time. The survey didn’t include children who are detained, “missing”, or living in health and care residential establishments, and the definition of a street gang is quite broad. The figure of 30,000 could vary a lot if there’s just a small amount of error in the survey’s findings. The 0.9% figure equates to about 26 young people (in a survey of 3,000) reporting themselves as being in a gang. In a repeat survey for 2016/17, it found 0.7% did so, but that’s the equivalent of about five fewer young people. Ultimately, the sample size, infrequency and wider data recording issues mean we can’t confidently say exactly how many children are in gangs, and whether this number has gone up or down in recent years. While this is the best available data we have on gangs, it cannot be taken as evidence that young people are fuelling a “violent crime epidemic”. This article does not assess whether or not there is such an “epidemic”. 0.9% of 10-15 year olds in England in Wales reported that they were a member of a street gang, according to ONS data for 2013/14, sourced to the Crime Survey for England and Wales. This is the data which the Times report says the office of the Children’s Commissioner used. In 2017, the Office of the Children’s Commissioner used the 0.9% figure to estimate that around 30,000 10-15 year olds were in street gangs in England, based on population figures for England (mid-2015). It also assumes that gang-membership levels are the same in both England and Wales. The ONS published more recent data in May this year (which wouldn’t have been available to the Children’s Commissioner when their report was published). It finds that 0.7% of 10-15 year olds in England and Wales reported being in a gang in 2016/17. It also reports that 0.2% of 16 to 24 year olds are a member of a street gang, compared to 0.7% in the 2013/14 data. The sample sizes of the research mean it’s hard to precisely estimate the number of children in gangs, or change over time. Applying the reported percentage of 10-15 year olds in gangs to population statistics suggests that the number in England has fallen by 7,000 from 2013/14 to 2016/17. Yet this is the equivalent to about five fewer people (in a survey of around 3,000) reporting that they are in a gang in the 2016/17 survey. Given what we also know about young children responding inaccurately, or giving “funny” answers, in surveys, this data isn’t good enough to give a very precise sense of change over time. Street gangs are also not necessarily committing criminal activities, according to the ONS definition. It told us its survey defined a street gang as:  “groups of young people who hang around together and The 30,000 figure formed part of a report on vulnerable children, in which the Children’s Commissioner recognised that the data available to it on street gangs was limited and “should be treated with caution”. It added: “The information for people involved in gangs or have been victims of gangs is very limited and our research revealed an important gap in the data.” It also highlighted that the ONS data doesn’t cover “people living in health and care residential establishments as well as people detained are not included in these estimates. Children included in the missing population may face an increased risk to be involved in gangs and thus the estimates may underreport the real numbers.” The Office of the Children’s Commissioner told us that: “We don’t collect data but collate it from many sources and sometimes the starting point for an estimate may be, in our own view, statistically dated, or weak but nonetheless, within certain standards, the best available at the time. Where that is the case we do what we think we can, transparently, to model towards a reasonable estimate of what the number is at the time of publishing.” The lack of consistently published data and limitations in recording practices mean it’s hard to get a perfect picture around the number of young people in gangs. It certainly seems a stretch to use the existing data as evidence of a phenomenon which is fuelling a supposed “violent crime epidemic”, given the limitations we highlight above. The Office of the Children’s Commissioner told us that: “Ever since the Office of the Children’s Commissioner undertook to assess the levels of vulnerable children in England in 2016, with a view to publishing findings in 2017, there has been a dual purpose. “Firstly to fill an existing statistical gap and find the best possible and reliable estimates we could for numbers that previously have not been calculated, and to beg the question “why hadn’t they been?” … “Secondly to highlight how hard it can be to arrive at those numbers when data collection can be patchy, sometimes non-existent, subject to local variation, variations of interpretation of official terms (not least the word ‘vulnerable’) and in what form the data came.” They also said that: “In looking to next year part of our call on Government and local authorities and other services will be to provide our calculations on Vulnerable Children with data that is fresher, more robust and comprehensive on the area of gang membership.”","We don’t know the exact number, and it’s difficult to get an accurate measure of this. In 2013/14, a survey found 0.9% of 10-15 year olds in England and Wales said they were in a street gang, which implies around 30,000 children in England, but this should not be taken as exact.

The UK is a world leader in robberies.
","“New Home Office analysis shows the UK is a world leader in... robberies.” Louise Haigh MP, 9 May 2018 “Government figures show the robbery rate shot up by 10% in a year—more [than] any of 12 other nations examined by the Home Office.” Daily Mirror, 9 May 2018 It’s correct that the number of recorded robberies in England and Wales increased by 10% from 2015 to 2016, and when factoring in population changes, the robbery rate per 100,000 people increased by 9%. Both of those increases are greater than in 12 other countries analysed by the Home Office.  Not all crimes are reported to, and recorded by the police, so these figures can only tell us so much about the true level of crime.  The UK doesn’t have more robberies, or robberies per person, than the rest of the world. The analysis by the Home Office looked at figures for England and Wales rather than the UK as crime figures are published separately for Scotland and Northern Ireland. England and Wales’s recorded reported robbery rate in 2016 was fourth highest of the countries included in the analysis, while Scotland’s robbery rate was the lowest. It’s difficult to make an exact comparison between the robbery figures in each country due to the different definitions of robbery and the way the figures are recorded in each country. Robbery is stealing or attempting to steal from a person or business using force or the threat of force. In 2015 there were around 51,000 robberies recorded by police in England and Wales, which increased to about 56,000 in 2016 (or by 10%). That’s 96 robberies per 100,000 people, a 9% increase on 2015, once you factor in the changes in population from 2015 to 2016. Since the Home Office analysis was published, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published data for 2017, showing that the number of robberies increased to about 74,000 (or by 33%) from 2016 to 2017. The ONS says that improvements in police recording may have had some impact on the rising numbers, but an actual increase in robberies may also have happened. Not all robberies are reported to the police so we can also use survey results to determine how many robberies may have happened in total in any given year. There were estimated to be 175,000 robberies (against people, these figures don’t include businesses) in 2017, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales. But because the figures are based on a survey and relatively few respondents may have experienced a robbery it’s hard to be precise. The ONS told us the figure could have been anywhere between 125,000 and 224,000 Not all countries have similar surveys measuring crimes, whether or not they’re reported, so we’ve not compared these figures with the countries in the Home Office analysis.   The Home Office analysis showed that between 2015 and 2016 the number of robberies in England and Wales increased more than in any of the other 12 countries examined. That doesn’t mean that the actual number of robberies was higher, even if you account for the different population sizes in each country. In 2016 the robbery rate in England and Wales was 96 per 100,000 people—lower than the USA, Spain and France, but above the other countries examined.   Despite increasing by a third in 2017 to 127 per 100,000, the robbery rate is still lower than the rate in France, but is now higher than the USA (some of the 12 countries in the original analysis haven’t released figures for 2017 yet so we can’t make a full comparison). Because each country records crime data in different ways, comparing data between countries should be taken with a pinch of salt. Recorded crime doesn’t capture the total level of crime as it doesn’t include crime that isn’t reported to the police. We don’t know how high the levels of reporting and recording are in each country. This could mean that that while some countries can have similar recorded robbery figures, the number of robberies that actually happen may be very different. Also police forces record crime differently in different countries. Most countries in Europe record crimes when they are initially reported to the police (input statistics). But in Germany and Spain crime is recorded when the investigation is over (output statistics) which Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office, say tends to be lower than input statistics.    And there are slightly different definitions of robbery in each country that affect comparability. For example, some countries exclude forms of bag-snatching, which are included in the robbery statistics for other European countries.","

People convicted for carrying a blade are spending longer in prison.
","“On the law enforcement side we’re catching more people carrying a blade, more are being prosecuted than ever before, and they spend longer in prison.” Dominic Raab MP, 17 May 2018 Between 2016 and 2017, there was a 33% increase in the number of offences relating to possession of an article with a blade or point recorded by police in England and Wales. There were over 17,000 offences involving possession of an article with a blade or point in 2017. The number of recorded offences involving possession of a knife in England and Wales has increased in recent years, though some of this rise could be down to improved police recording and “targeted police action in relation to knife crime”. Before then, recorded knife possession offences were on a downward trend since specifically recording possession of knives was introduced in 2009. Recorded knife crime generally has also been increasing and you can read more about that in our knife crime supercheck. There was a 12% increase in prosecutions for possession of an article with blade or point offences in England and Wales between 2016 and 2017, to just under 9,000. That includes prosecutions against children. The figures are for those prosecutions where possession of a knife was the defendant’s most serious offence if multiple offences are being tried.  There was a 9% rise in the number of knife and offensive weapon offences—specifically those relating to possession and aggravated possession—that led to a caution or a conviction in England and Wales between 2016 and 2017. The average custodial sentence for a knife or offensive weapon possession offence in England and Wales rose by 2.2 months between 2008 and 2017, to 7.5 months. 38% of offenders were sentenced to more than six months, compared to 20% in 2008. In 2015, a new minimum sentence of six months was introduced for adults convicted of possessing a knife or offensive weapon for the second time or more. Convictions are now more likely to result in a custodial sentence. In 2017, 63% of convictions of a knife or offensive weapon offence result in immediate custody or a suspended sentence, compared to 42% in 2008.

233,fullfact,"More people are being caught carrying blades.
","“On the law enforcement side we’re catching more people carrying a blade, more are being prosecuted than ever before, and they spend longer in prison.” Dominic Raab MP, 17 May 2018 Between 2016 and 2017, there was a 33% increase in the number of offences relating to possession of an article with a blade or point recorded by police in England and Wales. There were over 17,000 offences involving possession of an article with a blade or point in 2017. The number of recorded offences involving possession of a knife in England and Wales has increased in recent years, though some of this rise could be down to improved police recording and “targeted police action in relation to knife crime”. Before then, recorded knife possession offences were on a downward trend since specifically recording possession of knives was introduced in 2009. Recorded knife crime generally has also been increasing and you can read more about that in our knife crime supercheck. There was a 12% increase in prosecutions for possession of an article with blade or point offences in England and Wales between 2016 and 2017, to just under 9,000. That includes prosecutions against children. The figures are for those prosecutions where possession of a knife was the defendant’s most serious offence if multiple offences are being tried.  There was a 9% rise in the number of knife and offensive weapon offences—specifically those relating to possession and aggravated possession—that led to a caution or a conviction in England and Wales between 2016 and 2017. The average custodial sentence for a knife or offensive weapon possession offence in England and Wales rose by 2.2 months between 2008 and 2017, to 7.5 months. 38% of offenders were sentenced to more than six months, compared to 20% in 2008. In 2015, a new minimum sentence of six months was introduced for adults convicted of possessing a knife or offensive weapon for the second time or more. Convictions are now more likely to result in a custodial sentence. In 2017, 63% of convictions of a knife or offensive weapon offence result in immediate custody or a suspended sentence, compared to 42% in 2008.

","“Sadly an awful lot more people have died this year through stabbings or shooting, and more young men.” Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, 17 May 2018 It’s unclear if this is referring to deaths in London or across the whole of England and Wales. The closest data we have to this is for homicides involving stabbings in London until the end of last year and those stabbings or shootings across the whole of England and Wales in 2016/17. These show increases over the last few years. We’ve asked Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe for more information. We contacted the Metropolitan Police who told us that it didn’t generally give out an up-to-date running total on the number of homicides as these figures are published annually. Separate figures on the number of homicides involving sharp instruments suggests that the numbers have stayed relatively flat since 2013/14 but increased in the first nine months of 2017/18 (the most recent figures available). We haven’t found similar figures for shootings. Earlier this year the Metropolitan Police had told us there had been 38 fatal stabbings up until 20 April. Looking at the whole of England and Wales the number of homicides involving a sharp instrument had generally been decreasing over the past decade, but the number has increased in the past two years to 215 in 2016/17 (the most recent figures available), up from 212 in 2015/16. Similarly the number of homicides involving a shooting had generally decreased to a low of 21 in 2014/15, but has increased for the last two years, to 32 in 2016/17.  Around three-quarters of victims of homicides involving a sharp instrument in 2016/17 were male—and the majority of those were under the age of 34. The proportion who were male has increased in recent years, but is just below the level it was in 2007/08 (the highest recorded in the last decade).  Over half of all victims of firearms offences in 2015/16 were between the ages of 15 and 34—not including air weapons and including all offences, not just homicides. Figures on the gender and age of the homicide victims who die in shootings aren’t regularly published. Increases in knife and gun crimes recorded by the police are partly down to improvements in recording practices, but the Office for National Statistics also put this down to a genuine rise.

244,fullfact,"8% of stop and searches are knife crime related
","“Only 8% of stop and searches are knife crime related, the overwhelming majority are drug-related.” Iain Dale, 19 April 2018 This claim is actually just referring to London. In the first three months of 2018, about 9% of stop and searches resulting in a “positive outcome” were for “weapons, points and blades. That’s according to Metropolitan Police figures (which excludes the City of London). A positive outcome is where action is taken against people who’ve been stopped and searched, like arrests or warnings. The Met Police told us that “weapons, points and blades” included all offensive weapons except firearms, but including things like acid.   By comparison, 60% of stop and searches with a positive outcome were drug-related. We don’t have the same figures for England and Wales, but we do know that around 14% of searches that result in arrest involve offensive weapons, not including firearms. Just over half are for drugs. Given that these figures are only for arrests, we might expect weapons to account for a greater proportion of cases than in the London figures. But if you want to find out how effective stop and search is at rooting out weapons, it’s more useful to compare the total number of searches for weapons and the number of positive outcomes. In the first three months of this year, there were 5577 searches for weapons, points and blades, and 887 positive outcomes, which will include searches for other things (e.g. drugs) that happen to unearth a weapon. The latest data for England and Wales covers from April 2016 to March 2017 when there were nearly 33,000 searches for offensive weapons, and about 7,000 arrests (arrests being only one of the positive outcomes). These arrests may also come about from searches for other things.   The England and Wales figures relate to stop and searches made under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 which makes up 99.8% of all stop and searches.

245,fullfact,"Stop and search is achieving a higher arrest rate.
","“And what we have seen in the way stop and search is now being used, is it is achieving a higher arrest rate.” Elizabeth Truss MP, 19 April 2018 17% of stop and searches in England and Wales resulted in arrests in 2016/17, compared to 8% in 2009/10. There were over 300,000 stop and searches in 2016/17, compared to 1.4 million in 2009/10—meaning the overall number of stop and searches fell by 78%. While it's tempting to take the higher arrest rate as an indicator of success, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) note that an arrest isn't necessarily a success, nor is a failure to uncover any wrongdoing necessarily a failure. Offenders could, for instance, be arrested even if they're found to be empty of stolen or prohibited goods because they might react violently to officers or be wanted for another offence. On the flipside, failing to uncover wrongdoing could be regarded as a success if, without the stop and search powers in place, the person under suspicion would otherwise have been arrested unnecessarily. HMICFRS also reports that “While stop and searches on white people have decreased by 78 percent, stop and searches on people from BAME communities decreased by 69 percent. The decrease for black people was even lower, at 66 percent.” This is based on stop and searches under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which make up the vast majority of stop and searches. People who self-define as black or black British are the most likely to be stop and searched of any ethnic group—it’s estimated at around 29 per 1,000 in 2016/17. They’re over eight times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, and that ratio has been rising in recent years. HMICFRS said in December 2017 that the rising ethnic disparity in stop and search frequency “has the potential to erode public trust and confidence in the police, particularly amongst black people, despite the reductions in the use of stop and search powers”. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Correct. The arrest rate in England and Wales rose from 8% in 2009/10 to 17% in 2016/17.

246,fullfact,"Before recent reforms, fewer than one in 10 stops and searches led to an arrest. Now the rate is the highest on record.
","“In London, about one in three stops and searches results in some positive thing being found… something that you shouldn't have... that is quite a high proportion, frankly. “Our outcome rate—one in three positive—is the same, whether you're black or white or whoever you are.” Cressida Dick, 8 August 2017 “…before the reforms took effect, of more than one million stops taking place each year, fewer than one in ten ever led to an arrest… Since the reforms, the number of stop and searches has come down by almost two thirds while latest figures show that the stop-to-arrest rate is now the highest on record.” Amber Rudd, 9 August 2017 It’s correct that the use of stops and searches has fallen both in London and across England and Wales, following policy changes a few years ago. Officers do find something in about a third of cases in London, that’s more than the average for the whole of England and Wales. Black people remain much more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, and this gap has widened in the most recent year we have figures for. Almost all stops and searches take place under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and laws associated with that. It’s used by police to search people for things like drugs, weapons and stolen property, provided the officer has a reasonable cause to suspect they will find something. The use of section 1 searches has been declining rapidly in the last few years. Stops and searches can take place under different laws as well, but those have also been falling rapidly and have now fallen largely out of use. This is due to changes in policy since 2012 to increase ‘fair use’ of the powers by the Home Office and Metropolitan Police. The government also started a new scheme in 2014 called ‘Best use of stop and search’ which aimed to increase transparency around how stops and searches happened and to make forces more effective at identifying appropriate cases for using the powers. These changes have led to sharp falls in the use of stop and search both in London and throughout England and Wales. The use of stop and search in England and Wales peaked in 2008/09 when over 1.5 million were carried out. It has declined in every year since then. Since 2011/12—just before the police changes were brought in—stops and searches have fallen by two-thirds, as Amber Rudd correctly says. The latest figures put them at under 400,000 in 2015/16.  London has seen the same pattern. Stops and searches peaked in 2008/09 at nearly 600,000 and have fallen since to just under 160,000. Stop and searches are still much more common in London, once you factor in the resident population. This doesn’t take into account of the fact that a lot of people come to London from outside on a daily basis as well and could be stopped and searched but not counted in the population figures. Amber Rudd is correct about the increased arrest rate from stops and searches. Only 9% of stops and searches resulted in an arrest at the peak of its use between 2008 and 2011. That proportion has increased in the years since and was 16% by 2015/16. Arrests are more likely in London—with 19% of searches resulting in arrest in the same year. The most recent figures to June this year show the rate now at 20%. That’s according to figures gathered over the last year by the Metropolitan Police, and matches Cressida Dick’s claim. These are called “positive outcome” searches—which refers to any case where action is taken against people who’ve been stopped and searched. This includes arrest cases but also covers other resolutions like warnings and Penalty Notices. All cases where there isn’t a positive outcome are called ‘No Further Actions’. As Cressida Dick also says, the outcome rates are similar whatever people’s ethnicity is. White people are slightly more likely to have something found on them than black or Asian people, but the rate is roughly a third for all three groups. Across the rest of England and Wales, about a quarter of stops and searches had a positive outcome in 2015/16. This figure could be higher in reality because some No Further Action cases do involve detentions under the Mental Health Act or informal advice being given when an officer has found something untoward. At least, that’s what the latest ‘experimental figures’—i.e. to be interpreted with caution—show. These cover figures from just under half of police forces in England and Wales, not including the Metropolitan Police in London. They also find that whether someone is white or not makes little difference—the rate is still about 20%. Again, these cover ‘positive outcomes’ of stops and searches, but they’re different to the figures mentioned in the previous section because they only include cases where the officer found what they were searching for in the first place. The majority of the population is white and the majority of stops and searches involve white people. Per person, black people are more likely to be stopped and searched. Black people are about six times as likely to be stopped and searched as white people. Five in every 1,000 white people was stopped and searched in 2015/16, compared to 31 in every 1,000 black people.  The difference in rates between white and black people has grown since last year. Stops and searches have fallen in the last year overall but those involving white people have fallen faster than those involving black people. Black people are most likely to be arrested following a stop and search. 22% of stops and searches on black people resulted in an arrest in 2015/16, compared to 14% of those conducted on white people. We have more figures just for the Metropolitan Police in London covering the 11 months from August 2016 to June 2017. Black people seem more likely to be stopped in London than elsewhere in the country in recent years. White people are also more likely to be stopped in the capital. Black people were four times as likely to be stopped and searched in London as white people—they were stopped 38.5 times per 1,000 people compared to 9.8 times for white people.","Correct. Figures from 2008-2011 showed 9% of all stops and searches resulted in an arrest. By 2015/16, this was up to 16% - the highest on record.

A third of stops and searches in London results in something being found.
","“In London, about one in three stops and searches results in some positive thing being found… something that you shouldn't have... that is quite a high proportion, frankly. “Our outcome rate—one in three positive—is the same, whether you're black or white or whoever you are.” Cressida Dick, 8 August 2017 “…before the reforms took effect, of more than one million stops taking place each year, fewer than one in ten ever led to an arrest… Since the reforms, the number of stop and searches has come down by almost two thirds while latest figures show that the stop-to-arrest rate is now the highest on record.” Amber Rudd, 9 August 2017 It’s correct that the use of stops and searches has fallen both in London and across England and Wales, following policy changes a few years ago. Officers do find something in about a third of cases in London, that’s more than the average for the whole of England and Wales. Black people remain much more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, and this gap has widened in the most recent year we have figures for. Almost all stops and searches take place under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and laws associated with that. It’s used by police to search people for things like drugs, weapons and stolen property, provided the officer has a reasonable cause to suspect they will find something. The use of section 1 searches has been declining rapidly in the last few years. Stops and searches can take place under different laws as well, but those have also been falling rapidly and have now fallen largely out of use. This is due to changes in policy since 2012 to increase ‘fair use’ of the powers by the Home Office and Metropolitan Police. The government also started a new scheme in 2014 called ‘Best use of stop and search’ which aimed to increase transparency around how stops and searches happened and to make forces more effective at identifying appropriate cases for using the powers. These changes have led to sharp falls in the use of stop and search both in London and throughout England and Wales. The use of stop and search in England and Wales peaked in 2008/09 when over 1.5 million were carried out. It has declined in every year since then. Since 2011/12—just before the police changes were brought in—stops and searches have fallen by two-thirds, as Amber Rudd correctly says. The latest figures put them at under 400,000 in 2015/16.  London has seen the same pattern. Stops and searches peaked in 2008/09 at nearly 600,000 and have fallen since to just under 160,000. Stop and searches are still much more common in London, once you factor in the resident population. This doesn’t take into account of the fact that a lot of people come to London from outside on a daily basis as well and could be stopped and searched but not counted in the population figures. Amber Rudd is correct about the increased arrest rate from stops and searches. Only 9% of stops and searches resulted in an arrest at the peak of its use between 2008 and 2011. That proportion has increased in the years since and was 16% by 2015/16. Arrests are more likely in London—with 19% of searches resulting in arrest in the same year. The most recent figures to June this year show the rate now at 20%. That’s according to figures gathered over the last year by the Metropolitan Police, and matches Cressida Dick’s claim. These are called “positive outcome” searches—which refers to any case where action is taken against people who’ve been stopped and searched. This includes arrest cases but also covers other resolutions like warnings and Penalty Notices. All cases where there isn’t a positive outcome are called ‘No Further Actions’. As Cressida Dick also says, the outcome rates are similar whatever people’s ethnicity is. White people are slightly more likely to have something found on them than black or Asian people, but the rate is roughly a third for all three groups. Across the rest of England and Wales, about a quarter of stops and searches had a positive outcome in 2015/16. This figure could be higher in reality because some No Further Action cases do involve detentions under the Mental Health Act or informal advice being given when an officer has found something untoward. At least, that’s what the latest ‘experimental figures’—i.e. to be interpreted with caution—show. These cover figures from just under half of police forces in England and Wales, not including the Metropolitan Police in London. They also find that whether someone is white or not makes little difference—the rate is still about 20%. Again, these cover ‘positive outcomes’ of stops and searches, but they’re different to the figures mentioned in the previous section because they only include cases where the officer found what they were searching for in the first place. The majority of the population is white and the majority of stops and searches involve white people. Per person, black people are more likely to be stopped and searched. Black people are about six times as likely to be stopped and searched as white people. Five in every 1,000 white people was stopped and searched in 2015/16, compared to 31 in every 1,000 black people.  The difference in rates between white and black people has grown since last year. Stops and searches have fallen in the last year overall but those involving white people have fallen faster than those involving black people. Black people are most likely to be arrested following a stop and search. 22% of stops and searches on black people resulted in an arrest in 2015/16, compared to 14% of those conducted on white people. We have more figures just for the Metropolitan Police in London covering the 11 months from August 2016 to June 2017. Black people seem more likely to be stopped in London than elsewhere in the country in recent years. White people are also more likely to be stopped in the capital. Black people were four times as likely to be stopped and searched in London as white people—they were stopped 38.5 times per 1,000 people compared to 9.8 times for white people.","

The majority of the population is white and the majority of stops and searches involve white people. Per person, black people are more likely to be stopped and searched. Black people are about six times as likely to be stopped and searched as white people. Five in every 1,000 white people was stopped and searched in 2015/16, compared to 31 in every 1,000 black people.  The difference in rates between white and black people has grown since last year. Stops and searches have fallen in the last year overall but those involving white people have fallen faster than those involving black people. Black people are most likely to be arrested following a stop and search. 22% of stops and searches on black people resulted in an arrest in 2015/16, compared to 14% of those conducted on white people. We have more figures just for the Metropolitan Police in London covering the 11 months from August 2016 to June 2017. Black people seem more likely to be stopped in London than elsewhere in the country in recent years. White people are also more likely to be stopped in the capital. Black people were four times as likely to be stopped and searched in London as white people—they were stopped 38.5 times per 1,000 people compared to 9.8 times for white people.","

250,fullfact,"Migration is linked to 82% of population growth (between 2001 and 2016).
","“Migration linked to 82% of growth in the population” The Times, 23 August 2018 Population growth is driven by two things—net migration, and “natural change” (the difference between the number of births and deaths). From 2001 to 2016, migration accounted for 58% of this change in the UK. However, the think tank Migration Watch has asked what percentage of natural change is itself caused by migration—i.e. how much population change is driven by births to immigrant parents. It estimates that, from 2001 to 2016, 82% of population change was “linked” to migration—meaning it was driven either by net migration (roughly 50% of the overall change, once accounting for deaths of immigrants), or births to immigrant parents (roughly 35%, after accounting for deaths of people with immigrant parents). So it’s important to bear in mind these headlines aren’t just talking about the direct impact of net migration—they’re factoring in an estimate of the indirect impact of children of immigrant parents. This calculation is broadly accurate, and fits with wider demographic trends—net migration picked up significantly in the late 1990s, as did the number of children born to immigrant parents. However, the calculations rest on some uncertain assumptions —for instance, recordings of deaths don’t state whether someone is the child of an immigrant, so the deaths of people with immigrant parents has to be estimated using other data. There have also been recently highlighted issues with the accuracy of net migration data. This means that we should not treat the 82% figure as exact, but rather broadly accurate, and indicative of wider demographic patterns. The combined effect of net migration and natural change is used to estimate population increase each year. “Net migration” tells us the difference between how many people move in and out of the country (for at least 12 months) each year. This includes both foreign nationals and British citizens who immigrate or emigrate. “Natural change” is the difference between the number of births and deaths among the population each year. Analysis of Office for National Statistics (ONS) data by the Migration Observatory at Oxford University shows that, since the early 1990s, net migration has become an increasing driver of population change. It was a bigger driver than natural change in every year from mid-1998 onwards, except the years to mid-2012 and -2013. The rate of natural change has also picked up notably since the mid-2000s. Between mid-1991 and mid-2016, net migration accounted for 55% of total population growth in the UK—an additional 4.5 million people. In the year to mid-2017, it accounted for almost 60%, based on ONS data. Migration Watch, which produced the 82% figure, is looking at population change in a slightly different way. It also wants to know how much “natural change” is itself a result of migration—i.e. how many births in the UK are to immigrant parents. Migration Watch estimates that the twin impact of migration, and children born to immigrants, contributed 82% of the net population increase of 6.6 million between 2001 and 2016. Of that, it estimates that net migration contributed 3.1 million people (after accounting for deaths of immigrants in that period)—just under 50% of the increase. It estimates that “natural change” in terms of children born to immigrants added an additional net 2.3 million people to the population. This involves a number of calculations, some of which are fairly complex, and the overall picture seems correct. The net migration data is taken from the ONS. Migration Watch then has to estimate what percentage of natural change is down to migration. This is done by estimating the number of children born to non-UK born parents each year, using official data. The calculations we’ve seen are accurate. That said, it’s not possible to get a perfect measure for this—for example there’s the question of how to count a child born to one immigrant parent and one UK-born parent, as opposed to one with two immigrant parents. The research chose to count a child with one of each as 50% linked to migration. Migration Watch also has to estimate the number of deaths of immigrants and the children of immigrants each year. We haven’t seen the data on deaths of immigrants (as it’s not publicly available), and data on deaths doesn’t record whether or not someone is the child of an immigrant, so Migration Watch have produced a calculation which involves “a degree of assumption and interpolation”. The complexities of the calculation mean the numbers it produces are unlikely to be perfect. Indeed, based on its calculations, Migration Watch notes that there are slight disparities between what its estimates put population growth at each year, and the official data.  This is not a significant disparity however, and the figures broadly fit with what wider data tells us about migration. As outlined above, we know net migration has been rising in the last fifteen years. Births to immigrant mothers have also been rising since the 1990s, as the chart below shows. Another reason why the 82% figure should not be treated as perfect is that the official data (used by Migration Watch) may well be giving inaccurate estimates of net migration. It shows that the level of net immigration to the UK among non-EU citizens has been significant in the last ten years—with a cumulative increase of over 1.5 million people (before accounting for any deaths). However, UK population data tells a different story, showing that the growth of the non-EU-born population has been smaller (closer to one million). On the flipside, it could be undercounting the number of EU migrants who move to the UK. We’ve looked before at the reasons why this is happening (here). In short, we can’t know for sure whether the overall estimates are accurate or not, so this serves as a warning against treating migration figures as exact. The 2011 census also revealed that the survey which measures net migration data had been doing so inaccurately. Net migration figures between 2001 and 2011 were revised up as a result. We won’t know until after the next census in 2021 if that is still an issue. Numbers aside, the headline phrasing that over 80% of population growth is “linked” to migration has caused some controversy. It has been argued that, by combining migrants and their children into one figure “linked” to migration, Migration Watch is making the “assumption that the British born children of migrants are in some sense migrants”, or less integrated into the population. Migration Watch argues that it is undertaking a demographic analysis rather than an ethnic or cultural one. We don’t seek to comment on this debate. In any case, it’s helpful to break down the 82% figure into its constituent parts, and understand that it is the product of several trends. Otherwise, newspaper headlines about population change being linked to migration risk masking the complexities of the calculation. Update 19 September 2018  We previously compared net migration data on non-EU citizens with population data on the number of non-EU citizens, to show differences between the two datasets. We altered the comparison to look at population data on non-EU-born individuals, rather than non-EU citizens, as the data is more useful for comparison.","“Linked to” here combines an estimate of both net migration and children born to immigrant parents. This is likely to be on the right scale but too precise a figure, as it rests on a number of assumptions and uncertain data sources.

252,fullfact,"Home Office figures suggest new immigration rules will mean a reduction in unskilled EU migration of 90,000.
","“Skilled migration to the UK will rise under radical reforms to immigration that Boris Johnson signed off last week… “Home Office figures suggest the new rules will mean an overnight reduction in unskilled EU migrants of about 90,000 a year, who will no longer have a route into Britain.” The Sunday Times, 9 February 2020 An article in yesterday’s Sunday Times claimed that the government’s planned change to immigration rules will reduce unskilled EU migration to the UK by around 90,000 a year. The Sunday Times also reported that “the number of skilled migrants coming to the UK … [is] currently 65,000 a year. At the moment they are split equally between EU and non-EU migrants.” This appears to show the Home Office briefing two incompatible numbers. As economics professor Jonathan Portes pointed out, the total number of migrants who came from the EU for work in the year ending June 2019 totalled 90,000. If there are only 90,000 EU migrants coming to the UK for work and roughly 32,500 (half of 65,000) are skilled, then around 57,500 must be unskilled. You can’t reduce 57,500 by 90,000. Professor Portes told us that migrants are only assessed as being skilled or unskilled if they are making a work visa application, not if they are planning to migrate to the UK for any other reason, such as joining family or for study. We asked the Home Office for more details on the figures which, according to the Sunday Times, came from them. A spokesperson told us: “We will deliver on the people’s priorities by introducing a points-based immigration system from 2021 to attract the brightest and best talent from around the world, while cutting low-skilled immigration and bringing overall numbers down. We will set out the details of this firmer and fairer new system in due course.” It’s inappropriate for government departments to use figures that aren’t in the public domain, and figures like these should be published in full so that anyone can check where they’re from and how they’re calculated. We would ask the Home Office to publish its figures and methodology at the earliest opportunity. Reducing the number of EU migrants by 90,000 could be mathematically possible if you looked at all EU migrants, not just those coming to the UK for work-related reasons. For example, new laws could plan to reduce the number of both work-related migrants and non-work-related migrants. Or it’s possible that by reducing the number of unskilled migrants, there’s an associated reduction in the number of people migrating for non-work reasons (for example coming to stay with these workers under family visas).   It’s also possible that the Home Office briefed out-of-date-figures forecasting how much immigration might be reduced by, but which are not applicable now EU migration has dropped since the EU referendum.  But the Sunday Times mentions the figure specifically in the context of reducing the number of “unskilled EU migrants.” So even if the government’s plans could lead to a fall in EU migration of 90,000 it’s incorrect, based on the figures we have, to suggest that all of this will come from unskilled workers.","The number of unskilled EU migrants coming to work in the UK is already less than 90,000, so the government cannot cut it by 90,000 with changes to immigration rules.

","“Not only have we taken 41,000 unaccompanied children since 2010…” Boris Johnson, 29 January 2020 During Prime Minister’s Questions, Boris Johnson claimed that the UK has taken in 41,000 unaccompanied children since 2010. This claim was in response to a question from the SNP MP Carol Monaghan about unaccompanied child refugees. Home Office data shows that 41,396 asylum seekers and refugees under the age of 18 were granted leave to remain in the UK between 2010 and 2019. But not all of these were unaccompanied. 11,338 (27%) were classified by the Home Office as an unaccompanied asylum seeking child while 16,671 (40%) were accompanied. The remaining 13,387 young people granted leave to remain were part of resettlement schemes. We cannot tell from these statistics whether these young people were accompanied by a parent or carer, or if they were unaccompanied.

254,fullfact,"Migration has amounted to 80% of UK population growth.
","“Migration has amounted to, I think, 80% of the population increase, which is about one million every three years.” Iain Duncan Smith MP, 15 January 2020 On the Today programme, former Conservative party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith was asked about the government’s migration plans. He claimed that migration accounts for 80% of the population increase in the UK, amounting to one million people every three years. Since 2000 the UK population has increased by about 7.8 million. Of that, 4.6 million (60%) is the increase from net migration (the number of migrants coming to the UK, minus the number leaving). In recent years, it’s amounted to around 900,000 every three years and it’s been lower before that. This is according to the best available figures, though these still carry some uncertainty. Between 2017 and 2018, the increase in net migration made up closer to 70% of the change in population. Net migration has not directly accounted for 80% of the population increase at any point recently. So the figures mentioned by Sir Iain don’t appear to refer to net migration alone. However they could refer to research which looks not just at the direct population increase due to migration, but the indirect increase from children born to immigrant parents as well. This research puts the population increase due to migration at 82% of total population growth—equivalent to roughly a million people every three years between 2001 and 2016. As we’ve said before, this higher figure shouldn’t be taken as precise, as there isn’t enough data available to reach an accurate estimate of the population of children born to immigrant parents. It does, however, give an indication of the rough scale if you choose to include children in this way when talking about the impacts of migration. In any case, given that there are a number of ways to look at these figures, it’s unhelpful to describe this as the impact of “migration” on population growth without any context of what’s being counted.","This combines a rough estimate of both migration to and from the UK and children born to immigrant parents. Without counting children, migration directly accounts for 60% of UK population growth since 2000.

255,fullfact,"Labour pledged to scrap all controls on immigration
","“Labour to scrap all controls on immigration” The Telegraph front page, 26 September 2019. Following the conclusion of the Labour Party conference on Wednesday, the front page of the Telegraph’s Thursday edition reported that the party had agreed a policy to remove all controls on immigration. This is incorrect, as the Labour party pointed out. At its annual conference, Labour passed a broad proposal for its future migration policy. The motion said Labour will include manifesto pledges to, among other things, “maintain and extend free movement rights”, “close all detention centres”  and to “reject any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps/targets.” The full text of the proposal is available here. Afterwards, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott was quoted by the Guardian as saying: “Be assured, our plans for government include these provisions and a lot more,” indicating that the proposal would be adopted as party policy. The provisions laid out in the motion do seem to represent significant reductions in the barriers to immigrants coming to the UK and settling here. However claiming these proposals amount to the removal of “all controls on immigration” is exaggeration. Currently, EU citizens have the have the right to live and work in the UK (as an EU member state), with some exceptions. Labour’s motion plans to maintain this but does not specify how far it would extend rights of free movement (for example whether it would be applied to citizens of any other countries). Non-EU citizens are subject to more controls and enforcement, some of which the conference motion wants to relax, but it’s far from clear at this stage how far the party would want those changes to go. The motion doesn’t rule out all possible controls on migration—only certain types of immigration system.    It’s also important to note that a motion passing conference is a fairly early stage of the policy development cycle. The motion will now be fleshed out by the party. While it’s possible this could extend to scrapping all controls on immigration, claiming this is what was voted for yesterday is disingenuous.   The Telegraph’s article online didn’t contain the word “all” in the headline and copy. The headline online reads : “Labour to scrap controls on immigration and hand foreign nationals the right to vote.”","Incorrect. Labour passed a motion at its party conference to extend free movement and ruling out certain forms of immigration systems. This doesn’t mean scrapping all immigration controls.

268,fullfact,"If you come to the UK illegally, you are an illegal migrant, and I’m afraid the law will treat you as such.
","“The UK should not be regarded as a place where you can automatically come and break the law by seeking to arrive illegally. If you come illegally, you are an illegal migrant, and I’m afraid the law will treat you as such.” Boris Johnson, 23 August 2019 In reference to migrants attempting to cross the Channel to get from France to the UK, Boris Johnson said “If you come illegally, you are an illegal migrant, and I’m afraid the law will treat you as such.” This is not correct in all cases. Although it’s certainly true that crossing the Channel without authorisation isn’t a legal way to enter the UK, Article 31 of the UN Refugee Convention states that refugees cannot be penalised for entering the country illegally to claim asylum if they are “coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened” provided they “present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence”. A lot depends here on how to interpret which country people are “coming directly from”. It could be argued, for instance, that as the people crossing the channel are coming directly from France—which is not the country they initially fled—they don’t have the right to claim asylum in the UK. However, in 1999 a UK judge ruled that “some element of choice is indeed open to refugees as to where they may properly claim asylum.” The judge specified that “any merely short term stopover en route” to another country should not forfeit the individual’s right to claim refugee status elsewhere. This means people who enter the UK by illegal means can legitimately make a claim for asylum, even after passing through other “safe” countries, provided they do so directly after arriving. We’ve written about the rights of refugees in greater detail here. When Mr Johnson first made his statement on Friday, the Guardian politics liveblog called his statement misleading, after a reader alerted them to our original article.","Not in all cases. Specifically, refugees seeking asylum in the UK can’t be penalised for entering illegally if they are claiming asylum and coming from a place where their life or freedom are threatened. They may also stop over in other “safe” countries en route to the UK.

","“I agree that unfettered mass immigration has been used to depress wages, especially on the low skill level.” Lionel Shriver, 24 May 2018 “If you look at the evidence of why we have seen wages going down, there is actually very little evidence that that is being caused by migration, aside from in construction.” Anneliese Dodds, 24 May 2018 Both panellists hit on a key point: the impact of immigration on wages depends on who you are, what kind of job you do and where you do it. It also might not be the same from year to year. It is difficult to measure the overall effects of immigration on jobs definitively.

There is little evidence that falling wages are being caused by migration, aside from in construction.
","“I agree that unfettered mass immigration has been used to depress wages, especially on the low skill level.” Lionel Shriver, 24 May 2018 “If you look at the evidence of why we have seen wages going down, there is actually very little evidence that that is being caused by migration, aside from in construction.” Anneliese Dodds, 24 May 2018 Both panellists hit on a key point: the impact of immigration on wages depends on who you are, what kind of job you do and where you do it. It also might not be the same from year to year. It is difficult to measure the overall effects of immigration on jobs definitively.

257,fullfact,"A 10% rise in immigration leads to a 2% reduction in wages.
","“As the Bank of England said, for every 10% growth in immigration there is a 2% reduction in wages. That bears thinking about.” Boris Johnson, ITV, 9 June 2016 The 10% to 2% ratio, described by the Bank of England, does not show the relationship between changes in the immigration rate and UK average wages, as has been claimed. Their report was much more specific than this. The report suggested that an increase in the ratio of foreign-born workers to UK-born workers in lower-paid service occupations caused a small but significant reduction in the average pay for low paid workers in that region. It found that a 1.88% reduction in pay for semi-skilled and unskilled service workers would be expected to follow, on average, a 10% increase in the proportion of immigrants working in those jobs in a particular region. Examples of jobs in this category include child minders, cleaners, shop assistants, call centre staff, bar staff and postal workers. The reduction in average pay for semi-skilled and unskilled service workers is mainly due to a drop in wages for low-paid workers born in the UK. A small part is because immigrants tend to be paid less than native workers, bringing the average down further. The Bank of England also found that an increase in the ratio of foreign-born to UK-born workers seemed to have an effect on the average UK wage nationally. This effect was much smaller than the effect found when the report focused on particular groups of occupation. Whether the immigrant workers had come from inside or outside the EU made very little difference. Between 2004-2006 and 2012-2014 the ratio of foreign-born to UK-born workers rose by about 8% in low-skilled and semi-skilled service occupations across the UK as a whole. This was the largest change in any of the four occupational groups classified by the report. So for a low-skilled or semi-skilled occupation paid £8 per hour, this would work out to a drop of between 1 and 2 pence per hour, each year. Many issues have an affect on the wages of the lowest paid. Academics commonly list global changes in technology and trade, or national differences in education, attitudes to gender, and union activity as having a much more significant effect than having a higher proportion of immigrants in the workforce.","The Bank of England found that a 10% increase in the proportion of foreign born workers in lower paid service jobs was associated with a near 2% fall in average pay for those jobs, when focusing on particular regions.

52,fullfact,"In the UK, women earn less than men.
","“If you’re a woman, you will earn less than a man.” Theresa May, 13 July 2016 It’s true that you would expect a woman working in the UK to earn less than a man. In 2017, the median hourly wage for women working full time was about 9.1% less than the median hourly wage for men (excluding overtime). That’s £1.32 less per hour. Women also do more part time work than men. If you count part-time wages too, the gender pay gap rises to 18.4%, or £2.52 per hour. The Office for National Statistics says there isn't a single number that adequately deals with all the issues surrounding differences between women and men's pay, but they prefer to look at median hourly earnings. The gender pay gap is the difference between men’s and women’s earnings. It is normally calculated by subtracting median hourly earnings for women from median hourly earnings for men. The difference is the gender pay gap. This difference can also be expressed as a percentage of male earnings. Imagine you randomly picked 100 women who work in the UK and lined them up in order of who earns the most per hour, regardless of the hours they worked. Then imagine you randomly took 100 men and did the same, before standing the two rows face to face. If you walked halfway down the row, to the 50th woman and the 50th man, on average that woman would earn £2.52 less per hour than the man she was facing, or 18.4% less. If you only lined up people with full-time jobs, you would expect the median woman to earn 9.1% less than the median man, or about £1.32 less per hour. That’s the gender pay gap for median hourly wages. You would expect the 11th highest earning woman who worked full-time to earn 18.2% less than her male counterpart, about £5.68 less per hour. The 10th lowest earning woman would only earn 5.0% less, about 42p less per hour.  The differences are bigger if you look at weekly, monthly or annual earnings, since men tend to work more paid hours each week. They’re also larger if you included overtime pay, since men tend to do more hours paid overtime. Including overtime pay, the median hourly wage for a woman is 18.9% lower than the median wage hourly wage for a man, if you count full-time and part-time wages. That’s £2.61 less per hour. The pay gap actually works the other way around for part-time jobs—women get paid more than men. This is called the ‘negative gender pay gap’. The median hourly wage for women who work part-time is 5.1% higher than for men, so about 45p an hour more. But the median hourly wage for part-time jobs is 35% lower than the median hourly wage for full time jobs. That’s £4.82 less per hour—much larger than the negative pay gap. About 41% of women who work have part-time jobs, compared to just 13% of men. So the fact that more women do part time work widens the gap overall. The hourly gender pay gap for full-time workers dropped by 8.3 percentage points from 1997 to 2017, with the pay gap for all workers falling by about 9.1 percentage points. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests one reason for the decline is that the overall level of women‘s educational qualifications has increased more quickly than men’s. In the late 2000s women became the more qualified group. If we take education into account, we can see that the pay gap hasn’t fallen for everyone. Although it has fallen amongst workers with GCSEs as their highest qualification, the gender pay gap has stayed roughly the same for people with A levels and graduates. So the gap has declined overall for two reasons. First, because of the declining gap among workers with only GCSEs. Secondly, because more women have moved into the higher educated, and higher paid, groups. The negative gender pay gap for part-time workers increased by about 5.7 percentage points over the last 20 years. For full-time employees in their 20s and 30s the pay gap is relatively small. It increases by a large amount for full-time employees in their 40s and 50s, and declines slightly afterwards. The negative pay gap for part-time workers only occurs for those under the age of 50. Among older part-time workers, men generally get paid more than women. How do we explain this? Part of the difference is between generations. The pay gap has fallen for people born in later decades. But the gap also changes over a single generation’s lifetime. After the age of 30, the average hourly wage for men continues to rise whilst average hourly wages for women stay the same. The IFS suggest that this is mainly due to the knock-on effects of women reducing their hours or taking time out of work to have children. It identifies a gradual but continuous rise in the gender wage gap in the twelve years after families have their first child. The effect isn’t the same for all women. Highly educated women appear to miss out the most from taking time out of work. The lowest educated women lose out very little on pay increases by reducing their hours or taking time out of work. The IFS suggests that the increase in the size of the pay gap is because women lose out on accumulating workplace skills and experience. But, as the report says, it’s much easier to spot differences in career patterns than it is to prove they’re the cause of the widening gap. And their account doesn’t explain the part of the gap that exists before the birth of the first child. The IFS agreed that their preferred explanation doesn’t rule out alternatives—as long as those alternative explanations account for the data properly. What would that mean? They told us that any good explanation would need to account for the slow, cumulative increase in the gap after the birth of the first child. And it would need to explain why a gap exists before people have children. For full-time employees, the pay gap exists across all the main types of job. Correction 16 November 2017  In an older version of this article we said that the IFS briefing showed the gender pay gap had risen for graduates over time. We clarified this with the IFS who told us it has likely stayed at about the same level, but it’s difficult to say for sure.","This is true overall. The gender pay gap is 9.1% per hour for full time employees in the UK, or £1.32 per hour. It isn’t true just for part-time work or every individual age group, and the size of the gap varies across different types of job.

Women are getting ahead of men in terms of pay before they become mothers.
","“If you’re a woman in your twenties you will earn 95p for every pound that young men of your age earn.” Jo Swinson, BBC Today Programme, 4 January 2017 That’s a justifiable thing to say if you look at millennials. Jo Swinson based her claim on analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank. It looked at survey data from the Office for National Statistics and found that middle-earning women born between 1981 and 2000 earned around 5% per hour less than their male counterparts, a smaller gap than in previous generations. In other words, if you knew absolutely nothing else about two workers in the UK, aside from the fact that one was a woman, one was a man, and both were in their twenties, on average you would expect the woman to earn roughly 5% less per hour than the man. The claim also happens to be justified if you look at the middle-earning woman each week aged 22-29. She earned around 6% less each week than the middle-earning man last year. Although there is a gap between the pay of men and women, it’s harder to say what the statistic tells us. As the Resolution Foundation pointed out, its measure of the ‘gender pay gap’ isn’t comparing like-with-like. It’s comparing median average earnings in the whole group of women who work, against the whole group of men who work. That’s a bit different from what people often think of as the ‘gender pay gap’: the idea that a woman will be paid less than a man for doing exactly the same job. For one reason or another, men and women in the UK tend towards different kinds of jobs, tend to work different hours, and arguably develop different skills and experience. So there are a range of additional reasons why the gender pay gap might exist, alongside the possibility of outright discrimination. Although gendered wage inequalities suggest a lot about the way we organise and value different kinds of work across society as a whole, and particularly how these kinds of social pressures and choices are gendered, they aren’t a direct measure of discrimination in the workplace. And there’s more than one reasonable way to measure them. The ONS suggests looking at full-time workers alone is a good headline measure. But the Resolution Foundation told us that it chose to include part-time workers this time, since it thinks the gap in hourly pay between full-time and part-time work is an important issue. As the ONS has put it: “…there is no single measure that fully deals with the complex issue of the differences between men’s and women’s pay” Different measures of the gender pay gap will capture different aspects of how the UK labour market is shaped by gender. “…women are going ahead of men before they have children and when they are concentrating on their careers, but what clearly is not happening is women are not maintaining their position ahead of men once they make different decisions about the priority of family life.” Jill Kirby, BBC Today Program, 4 January 2017 On the one hand, there’s evidence that the gender pay gap increases later in life, partly as women become mothers. A recent report by the IFS think tank chose a third measure of the gap to both the Resolution Foundation and the ONS, which helped illustrate a different point: it showed that although a gap in mean average pay for men and women exists before people become parents, the gap increases steadily and substantially for 12 years after the birth of their first child. The IFS’ main interpretation is that mothers who choose to take time out of work miss out on workplace skills and experience, and so lose the opportunity for career progression. As with other statistics on gendered pay inequalities, there’s room for a range of interpretations. On the other hand, we haven’t seen clear evidence yet that the same women are getting ahead of men in terms of pay before they have children. The IFS found that over a third of the eventual difference in average wages between mothers and fathers existed before the first child was born. Jill Kirby pointed us to a Guardian article from 2015, which was based on data collected by the Press Association. This suggested that women in their twenties were earning more than men. It’s not clear exactly how these figures were put together, or whether the analysis is still up-to-date, so we’ve asked the Press Association for the original release. Back in 2015, it was true that women aged 22-29 working full-time earned more each hour than their male counterparts. That was no longer the case in 2016.","
 
We’ve not seen clear evidence that women are getting ahead on average, even though women and men are paid more equitably in their 20s than later in life.

","“We have the highest female employment rate on record, we have the highest percentage of women on FTSE 100 boards on record, the gender pay gap is at the lowest on record... there’s still much more to do...” Amanda Milling MP, 8 March 2017 It’s true that we have the highest female employment rate on record. A higher proportion of women aged 16-64 are in paid work than ever before and the same is true if you count everyone up to state pension age. There’s still a nine percentage point gap between the employment rate for men and women aged 16-64. We also have very near to the highest ever percentage of women on FTSE 100 boards, according to the professional forum Boards Watch. The FTSE 100 includes the hundred most highly-valued companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. About 27% of directors on their boards are women: 32% of non-executive directors and 10% of executive directors. The proportion seems to have fallen fractionally in the months leading up to March 2017, although that’s nothing compared to the large year-on-year increases that came previously. Finally, it’s true that the gender pay gap is the lowest on record by median hourly earnings. That’s correct whether you compare hourly earnings across all workers, or just look at full time workers. There’s still a gap. If you knew nothing about two people except that one was a man, one was a woman, and both were working full-time, then you’d expect the woman to earn about £1.34 per hour less than the man. Your expectations would change if you knew a bit more about them. The gender pay gap varies according to things like age, how much you get paid, the hours you work and the type of job you do.

More FTSE 100 board directors are women than ever before.
","“We have the highest female employment rate on record, we have the highest percentage of women on FTSE 100 boards on record, the gender pay gap is at the lowest on record... there’s still much more to do...” Amanda Milling MP, 8 March 2017 It’s true that we have the highest female employment rate on record. A higher proportion of women aged 16-64 are in paid work than ever before and the same is true if you count everyone up to state pension age. There’s still a nine percentage point gap between the employment rate for men and women aged 16-64. We also have very near to the highest ever percentage of women on FTSE 100 boards, according to the professional forum Boards Watch. The FTSE 100 includes the hundred most highly-valued companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. About 27% of directors on their boards are women: 32% of non-executive directors and 10% of executive directors. The proportion seems to have fallen fractionally in the months leading up to March 2017, although that’s nothing compared to the large year-on-year increases that came previously. Finally, it’s true that the gender pay gap is the lowest on record by median hourly earnings. That’s correct whether you compare hourly earnings across all workers, or just look at full time workers. There’s still a gap. If you knew nothing about two people except that one was a man, one was a woman, and both were working full-time, then you’d expect the woman to earn about £1.34 per hour less than the man. Your expectations would change if you knew a bit more about them. The gender pay gap varies according to things like age, how much you get paid, the hours you work and the type of job you do.

286,fullfact,"58% of people in the UK would be comfortable with a female head of state.
","“The Reykjavik Index for Leadership ranks… G7 countries in terms of the percentage of people who would be comfortable with a female head of state. The U.K., which is currently led by Prime Minister Theresa May, came first with 58%” Axios, 27 November 2018 Market research company Kantar recently put out some figures about how different countries view female leaders. It surveyed around 900 working-age adults (age 18 to 64) in each of the G7 countries (UK, USA, France, Canada, Japan, Germany and Italy). In four of the seven countries less than half of people would be “very comfortable” with a female head of government, according to Kantar’s findings. In the UK, the published figures show 58% of people would feel “very comfortable” with a female head of government.    But it’s not correct to say based on this that 58% are “comfortable”. Nor is it correct to assume that everyone who didn’t say they were “very comfortable” with a female leader is uncomfortable. Here’s why: Kantar told us that the exact question asked was: “How comfortable do you or would you personally feel about having a woman as the head of government in your country?” That hypothetical phrasing was used even if the country actually had a female head of government—as is the case in the UK and Germany. (And it’s possible that fact in itself would have influenced the results in those countries). The answers respondents could choose from ranged from very or fairly comfortable to not very or not at all comfortable. They could also choose ‘don’t know’. So respondents could choose a range of options to express how comfortable with a female leader they were. The report by Kantar shows us that many people answered “very comfortable” but not how many answered with the other options. So although 58% of people in the UK were ‘very comfortable’ with the idea of a female head of government, the proportion that were either fairly or very comfortable was higher. By the same reasoning, you also can’t infer from the published data how many people in each country would be uncomfortable with a female head of state. Kantar gave us the full UK results to the question. These showed that in the UK, 58% of people said they were “very comfortable” with a female leader and another 29% said they were “fairly comfortable”. 9% said they were not very or not at all comfortable.  There’s a limit to how much the data can tell us about attitudes towards women as heads of government across the G7. Kantar didn’t ask respondents how they would feel about having a male head of government—so we can’t compare the two sets of figures. It also didn’t ask any follow up questions as to why people were comfortable (or not) with women as heads of government—for example if it was linked to their gender, the performance of particular high profile politicians, or a general distrust of politicians. Kantar did ask respondents whether they thought men or women are more suitable for leadership positions in government and politics more widely (rather than as the out-and-out head of state). It found that while between 23% and 58% of adults in each G7 country felt “very comfortable” with a female head of government, a far higher number (79%  ) of adults felt men and women are equally suited to leadership positions in government and politics. 8% felt women were more suited to these positions than men and 13% felt men were more suited than women. ","A recent survey found 58% of UK adults aged 18-64 would be “very comfortable” with a female head of government, and a further 30% were “fairly comfortable”.

But it’s not accurate to suggest that this was a decision the BBC made itself. The level of increase is as a result of a decision by the government in 2016 which announced that from 2017/18 the licence fee would rise in line with inflation.  At the time, the government said “this will provide the BBC with the funding it needs to thrive and deliver against its updated mission and purposes.” Inflation in the year to September 2019 was measured at 2%, and so the licence fee is increasing from £154.50 to £157.50 (1.9%).

282,fullfact,"Jeremy Corbyn will cost every British worker £2,400 per year.
","“The true 'cost of Corbyn': £2,400 a year for every British worker, claim Tories” The Telegraph, 12 November 2019 The Conservatives have claimed that every taxpayer in the UK will have an additional bill of £2,400 per year under Labour. But problems with the calculation make this claim largely meaningless. They estimated the total cost of Labour’s policies over five years, and then estimated that, of that sum, £374 billion would not be covered by Labour’s previous pledges on additional borrowing or taxes. They call this a £374 billion funding “black hole” which taxpayers will have to cover, and claim it translates into a cost of £2,400 per income tax payer per year, over five years. But, as we’ve already said, the Conservatives’ estimate of the total cost of Labour’s policies has serious problems. They can’t know what the Labour party’s policies will cost because Labour hasn’t released its 2019 election manifesto yet and we don’t know exactly what all its policies will be. The Conservatives’ calculation includes a number of policies that Labour hasn’t so far said will be in its manifesto, and one which it has ruled out. Other calculations made by the Conservatives seem overstated, either by double counting costs or assuming Labour would introduce the fully-fledged policy from day one, rather than phasing it in. Because this £2,400 a year figure is derived from that larger estimate, it suffers from the same flaws. Those problems aside, it’s not possible to convert the supposed £374 billion funding “black hole” into a uniform cost of £2,400 for every one of the UK’s 31 million income tax payers, as the Conservatives have done. That’s because if Labour had to raise this extra revenue, it wouldn’t be obliged to do it through income tax. It could, for example, look at corporation tax or VAT instead, which would still be a cost but to different groups and spread out unevenly. And even if it raised the revenue through higher income tax, higher earners pay more income tax—meaning they would pay more than lower earners. BBC Reality Check also points out that the Conservatives’ assumptions about Labour’s tax-raising plans rely on documents which Labour has not formally adopted as party policy.","This figure is largely meaningless as the calculations and assumptions behind it have a number of flaws.

283,fullfact,"Labour’s spending plans would cost £1.2 trillion over five years.
","“Corbyn’s Labour would spend £1.2 trillion over the next five years if they get elected”. Conservative party, 10 November 2019 On Sunday a number of front pages carried the story that Conservative analysis of Labour party policies put the cost of a Labour government at £1.2 trillion over five years. The Conservatives’ analysis is looking at policies put forward by the Labour party in their 2017 election manifesto, or in the two years since. But the Labour party hasn’t released its 2019 election manifesto yet, so it’s impossible to know exactly what its policies would be if in government. It’s impossible to cost a manifesto that hasn’t been released yet. As no other party has released its manifesto either, it’s also impossible to compare to the cost of any other party’s policies (including the Conservatives’). The list includes a number of policies that Labour hasn’t so far said will be in its manifesto and one (the abolition of private schools) that Labour has ruled out. Other numbers seem overstated, either by double counting costs or assuming Labour would introduce the fully fledged policy from day one, rather than phasing it in. Some of the figures are reasonable, and some are taken directly from Labour’s own announcements. Over half of the £1.2 trillion figure is based on the Conservatives’ estimate of the cost of Labour’s 2017 manifesto, but it’s not clear how many policies from that will appear in the 2019 version. Around half of the £1.2 trillion over five years comes from a costing of Labour’s 2017 election manifesto. It includes figures put forward by Labour at the time as well as the Conservatives’ estimate of Labour’s ‘uncosted’ spending from the manifesto. In 2017 Labour said that its manifesto policies would cost £48.6 billion a year in day to day spending. Over five years that’s £243 billion. At the time, Labour also put forward tax measures it claimed would pay for that spending. Labour also said in 2017 it wanted to spend around £25 billion a year on infrastructure and investment—over five years that’s £125 billion. When the 2017 Labour manifesto was originally published the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that a number of Labour’s policies could turn out to be more costly than it had estimated. That still leaves another £243 billion that the Conservatives say is ‘uncosted spending’ from the last manifesto. A large chunk of this comes from the supposed cost of Labour’s plans to renationalise rail, energy networks, water and postal services which the Conservatives have factored in at £196 billion.  This figure comes from analysis by the CBI, and when we fact checked it back in October we found that the methodology behind the figure was disputed and didn’t take into account the potential economic benefits of nationalisation. The Conservatives also seem to have double counted the cost of renationalising the National Grid under both Labour’s 2017 manifesto and under new spending since then. The National Grid is part of the £196 billion price tag for nationalisation from Labour’s 2017 manifesto, according to the CBI’s analysis. But it’s also reportedly part of a separate £124 billion pot of money the Conservatives say is the cost of renationalising the ‘Big Six’ energy supply companies—an extension of Labour’s 2017 energy pledges. The £124 billion figure is based on analysis by stock brokerage firm Jefferies from 2015. As far as we can tell, Jefferies never publicly released their methodology, but multiple press reports at the time said that it was an estimate of the cost of nationalising the Big Six as well as the National Grid.  According to a chart in the Guardian based on Jefferies’ figures, just under £60 billion of the £124 billion estimate was due to the value of the National Grid. The Conservatives also said that Labour’s plan to upgrade UK housing and install energy saving measures will cost £30 billion over five years.  This figure does seem to be in line with Labour’s own calculations. When it announced the policy last week it said it would cost £250 billion in total, with £60 billion of that coming from public spending under a Labour government by 2030. The Conservatives have taken this total for around 10 years and halved it to get a five year figure of £30 billion. Another figure which seems to originate with Labour is the £50 billion allocated to a housing grant for socially rented homes. A motion voted for at Labour’s party conference called on the party to commit to setting aside £10 billion a year to build 100,000 socially rented homes. That doesn’t mean this is definitely going to be in Labour’s 2019 manifesto. The Conservatives multiplied £10 billion by five to get to £50 billion, which assumes that Labour would start implementing the policy straight away once in government. Labour recently announced at its party conference in September that in government it would look to reduce the average full-time working week to 32 hours within the next decade. The Conservatives say this will cost £85 billion over five years, or £17 billion a year.  That is based on research done by the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), a centre-right think tank, which estimated that moving to a 32 hour week would cost between £26 billion and £45 billion a year, depending on how you calculated the average number of hours people work at the moment. The CPS also said that in an “incredibly optimistic” scenario, increased productivity from working longer hours could generate £9 billion, leaving the cost of the policy at at least £17 billion. But the Conservatives seem to have assumed that Labour would introduce this policy from day one of a Labour government, rather than phasing it in over a decade as Labour have previously said.  The Conservatives say £35 billion of the total cost would come from Labour’s policy to abolish private schools.  Labour said in a press release on 31 October this year that this was not its policy. The Labour party conference in September did pass a vote supporting the integration of private schools into the state sector and the redistribution of their assets, but that does not commit the party to including the policy in its manifesto.  The currently stated Labour policy is to remove charitable status and various tax benefits from private schools, and then (as their press release put it) “ask the Social Justice Commission to consider the ways in which we can integrate private schools into the state sector”. But even if it was Labour policy, the Conservatives’ calculations are flawed.  The Conservatives added together estimates from consultancy Oxford Economics for the amount they say independent schools save the taxpayer by teaching pupils who would otherwise have a state education (£3.5 billion per year) and the amount of tax revenue generated from independent schools (£3.5 billion per year), and multiplied by five to get the £35 billion figure.  The Conservatives actually used the wrong figure for the amount of revenue generated by private schools. Oxford Economics estimated that independent schools contributed £4.1 billion of tax per year (£3.5 billion was only a subset of independent schools).  Regardless, it’s wrong to say that closing private schools would mean the government sees a reduction in tax revenues. The tax revenue figure covers tax currently generated through spending by independent schools. This includes things like tax paid by teachers and tax generated when schools buy things, but a lot of that would be generated if the private schools closed and the state sector had to expand too.  Estimations like these are uncertain, but a better estimate is that moving privately educated pupils into the state sector would cost £3.5 billion a year—half of what the Conservatives have estimated.  Around £67 billion in the analysis comes from what the Conservatives say is Labour’s policy of “early retirement for women born in the 1950s”. In 2017, after the general election, Labour pledged to “allow these women to retire up to two years early.” The state pension age is rising and in 2011 the government passed measures to speed up how quickly this was happening, meaning almost five million people would not be able to claim the state pension until later than they originally thought.  The Conservatives said they took the average value of the state pension for women in 2018/19 and multiplied by the additional number of people who would receive the state pension under Labour’s plans for a duration of two years. This includes back-payments for women who didn’t receive their pension so soon.  We haven’t been able to replicate the Conservatives’ calculations and there is not enough detail on Labour’s proposals to accurately estimate the cost of their policy. We’ve asked both for more information. Another figure that the Conservatives have taken straight from Labour is the proposed cost of upgrading school buildings. In 2018 Labour said it would spend £14 billion to upgrade school buildings, and that would include fire safety measures such as fitting sprinklers and removing potentially flammable cladding. It’s unclear what period Labour intended this to be spent over. The Conservatives say Labour’s plans on public sector pay would cost around £38 billion over five years. That’s based on a statement Jeremy Corbyn made in July 2018, backing trade union calls for a 5% rise in public sector pay.  The Conservatives’ cost estimate is based on the above-inflation cost of a 5% pay rise every year for five years (though we’ve not been able to replicate their exact calculations). But there’s no suggestion from Labour that the demand for a 5% pay rise was intended to be every year, so this could overstate Labour’s intentions. The Conservative party seems to have tried to avoid double counting in this instance. Its initial estimate of this policy was £58 billion, but around £20 billion of the amount was already included in Labour’s costings of their 2017 manifesto. Labour estimated lifting the public sector pay cap would cost £4 billion a year (we fact checked this in 2017 and found it was a reasonable estimate for raising public sector pay in line with inflation). The Conservatives say that Labour’s public health pledges would cost £3.2 billion per year or £16 billion over five.  That is based on Labour’s repetition of the Health Foundation’s calculations from 2018 that an additional £3.2 billion a year is needed to reverse the impact of decreased funding to public health services. We can’t find evidence that Labour has actually pledged to increase spending by this amount if it got into government, although Johnathan Ashworth did ask ministers in 2018 to reverse the cuts in that year’s budget. The Conservatives calculate that scrapping Universal Credit will cost £16 billion, and point to multiple associated costs: infrastructure for a new benefit system; ending the benefit cap; ending the two child limit; and recruiting 5,000 additional advisers. These are all things which Labour has pledged to do. By far the biggest single estimated cost is almost £15 billion, which the Conservatives say is the cost of Labour’s pledge to remove the two child limit which means most parents can only receive child tax credit for the first two children they have. The Conservatives say the two child limit “was estimated to have saved” £3 billion a year. This seems to come from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), which says the two child limit is expected to reduce government spending by £3 billion “in the long run”. The Conservatives used this as an annual figure and factored in that changes to this policy were made in 2019 which cost around £250 million. But £3 billion wouldn’t be wouldn’t be the cost of reversing the policy in each of the next five years. The two child limit was expected to lead to spending reductions of £310 million in 2017/18, rising to £1.6 billion in 2020/21 and £2 billion by 2021/22, according to the House of Commons Library, so it hasn’t yet reached the £3 billion figure projected by the IFS. The Conservative party also claims that ending the benefit cap will cost £190 million a year, or £950 million over five years. Its source is a parliamentary report which says the £190 million figure is “likely to be an overestimate”.  The Conservatives estimated that Labour’s pledge to deliver free personal care in England would cost £32 billion over five years. This seems fair.  Personal care is help for those who need assistance with things like diet, mobility and simple treatments, and is already free in Scotland. Healthcare think tank The King’s Fund estimated expanding this to England would cost an extra £6 billion in 2020/21 and £8 billion by 2030/31.  The Conservatives assumed an incremental increase in cost of £0.2 billion a year over the first five years, getting to £32 billion over the whole period. At the time of writing, Labour hadn’t yet released its manifesto for the 2019 election, so we don’t know exactly which policies it will include or how much they’re likely to cost. Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said in response to the Conservatives’ analysis: “This ludicrous piece of Tory fake news is an incompetent mish-mash of debunked estimates and bad maths… The Conservatives will be able to read all about [Labour’s] plans – and how much they actually cost – when we publish our fully costed manifesto.”","Labour hasn’t published its 2019 manifesto yet, so nobody knows. This is largely based on Labour’s previous policy announcements. Many of the figures behind this estimate are uncertain or based on flawed assumptions.

Ken Clarke, former Conservative Chancellor said he won’t vote for the Conservatives.
","Today Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott tweeted about media coverage of former Labour MP Ian Austin, claiming that it was unbalanced when contrasted with coverage of comments made recently by former Conservative MP and Chancellor Ken Clarke.   Ian Austin, 1 year as a junior minister at DCLG, says he won't vote for Labour. Wall-to-wall coverage. Ken Clarke, 9 years as Secretary of State, including as Chancellor, says he won't vote for the Conservatives. Silence. Balanced election coverage? While it’s true that the two sets of comments received different levels of media attention, Ms Abbott’s phrasing doesn’t portray them entirely accurately, overstating what Ken Clarke said and implying the two sets of comments to be more similar than they are. Mr Austin didn’t just say he personally wouldn’t vote Labour this election; this morning he explicitly called on Labour voters to vote for the Conservatives.

284,fullfact,"Ian Austin, former Labour MP has said he won’t vote for Labour.
","Today Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott tweeted about media coverage of former Labour MP Ian Austin, claiming that it was unbalanced when contrasted with coverage of comments made recently by former Conservative MP and Chancellor Ken Clarke.   Ian Austin, 1 year as a junior minister at DCLG, says he won't vote for Labour. Wall-to-wall coverage. Ken Clarke, 9 years as Secretary of State, including as Chancellor, says he won't vote for the Conservatives. Silence. Balanced election coverage?

54,fullfact,"New gender pay gap figures reveal 8 out of 10 firms pay men more.
","“Gender pay gap figures reveal eight in 10 UK firms pay men more” The Guardian, 4 April 2018 New rules means that all UK employers with over 250 staff have to report their gender pay gap to the government. Over 10,000 employers had responded at the time of writing, of which around 5% either had under 250 employees, or didn’t provide the total number. 78% of these employers had a gender pay gap in March or April 2017. That’s around eight in ten. Among these firms, the median hourly wage for women is 10% less than for men. That compares to around 18% across all UK workers. These figures refer to full and part-time workers. It’s the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings, and is often expressed as a percentage of male earnings. That’s not the same as unequal pay—when men and women get paid different amounts for doing the same work. That’s been unlawful since 1970. 14% of employers with more than 250 employees reported no gender pay gap, and 8% have a negative gap (meaning women have a higher median hourly salary than men). Men had higher median bonuses at 53% of organisations, with women having the higher average at 15%. Across all employers of 250 people or more, the median bonus for a woman was 6% lower than for a man. The data also allows you to look at the specific situation at each of the 10,000 organisations in more detail. You can search for any organisation covered by the data here. On average, the bigger the employer-size, the higher the gender pay gap.The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that “over time the data will allow the monitoring of trends in gender pay gaps in different industries”. But it adds that the figures must be interpreted with care. It suggests that there may be different reasons for pay gaps in different organisations and at different points in employees’ careers. For example, it says “research also shows that some, but not all, of the gender wage gap is explained by the fact that after having children women are much more likely than men to work part-time, and part-time work is associated with little or no subsequent progression in hourly wages.” It also suggests there may be some errors in the figures organisations have submitted. For example, the number of employers reporting their pay gap to be exactly zero (in mean and median terms) is larger than would be expected. All employers with over 250 employees have to report their gender pay gap. This is based on a “snapshot date” in March or April 2017. Both full and part-time workers are included, and each is counted as one individual employee. Agency workers are counted as the employees of their agency or service company. Self-employed people are counted in an organisation’s data if they “personally perform” work for them. Employees based overseas are generally included if their contract is subject to English, Scottish, or Welsh law. Correction 2 May 2018  We amended the claim to specify that they were ""gender pay gap"" figures, and amended the conclusion to further explain what the gender pay gap is.","New rules mean all UK employers with 250+ employees have to report their gender pay gap. 10,000 employers responded, and 78% pay men more than women on average, based on median hourly earnings.

99,fullfact,"The gender pay gap is at its lowest level.
","“The gender pay gap is at its lowest level.” Claire Perry, 8 February 2018 This is broadly correct, comparing the median hourly earnings of women and men in the UK, excluding overtime pay. The gap has been falling almost consistently over time, although there was a slight increase in the provisional data for 2017.  These figures don’t show differences in rates of pay for comparable jobs, as they are affected by factors such as the proportion of men and women in different occupations. For example, a higher proportion of women work in occupations such as administration and caring, which tend to offer lower salaries. The Office for National Statistics says there isn't a single number that adequately deals with all the issues surrounding differences between women and men's pay, but they prefer to look at this measure of median hourly earnings. We looked at this issue in more depth last year. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Broadly correct.

93,fullfact,"At least a large part of growth in employment has been driven by an increase in insecure, precarious work.
","The employment rate in the UK is high by historic standards. At the beginning of 2017 a larger proportion of working-age people had a job of some description than had ever been recorded before. But not everyone’s convinced that’s the whole story and some of our readers have questioned it in the past:  So how much of the rise in employment been driven by a rise in insecure, precarious work? From the statistics, it doesn’t seem like unwanted part-time work or unsatisfactory temporary work has been the major driver behind the growth in employment. It’s a question that’s hard to answer with statistics alone, partly because one person’s idea of a “good job” won’t suit another’s. Some people will value secure employment, others flexibility, and presumably most people will want a degree of both. How secure people feel will also depend on things like their relationship with their employer and their own disposition. So questions of job quality are hard to answer satisfactorily with numbers. The proportion of workers who simply can’t find permanent or full-time jobs did increase after the recession but it’s been falling for the past few years now. The proportion of people who have a job has risen in the past few years to a record high (it’s been driven partly by a rise in the proportion of working-age women with a job).  Some of those people have either part-time jobs or temporary work (or both). Not all of them are happy about it. About 3% of UK workers work part-time mainly because they can’t find a full-time job. That is around 12% of the 8.4million part-time workers. Between 1-2% of people in employment have a temporary job mainly because they can’t find a permanent one. Around 28% of the 1.6 million temporary workers in the UK.  If we count these people out of the employment figures it makes very little difference to the overall picture. The employment rate for those aged 16+ is still relatively high by historic standards. We’ve used the employment rate for everyone over the age of 16 in the graph below so that we’re using an age group which is consistent with the over- and underemployment statistics (which we’ll get to shortly). The 16+ employment rate is slightly lower than the 16-64 employment rate because it includes people above state pension age, an age group that’s less likely to be in work.  The Office for National Statistics also collects data on people who want to work more or fewer hours. That’s a wider group than just the people who are technically “underemployed” or “overemployed”. To count as “underemployed” you need to be seeking more hours, work no more than the maximum weekly working hours already, and be able to make the change within the next two weeks. About 11% of employed people say they’d like to work more hours. But 8% of people in employment meet the criteria and are classed as “underemployed”. You’re only classed as “overemployed” if you want to work fewer hours and know you’d be prepared to take a pay cut to do it. About 31% of people with a job would prefer to work fewer hours, but only 10% say they’d definitely take a pay cut to do it.  The proportion of workers who are happy with their hours seems to have been steadily rising over the past fifteen years.  Self-employment has become more common too. There’s a fear among some that the economy is headed increasingly away from secure jobs and towards short-term, casual work. The statistical evidence we’ve seen suggests that people are generally taking up self-employment happily. We can also say that industries that make up the ‘gig economy’ still employ a relatively small proportion of the workforce. If these developments in the jobs market are a worry, it seems to be more of a concern about the direction of travel, rather than about where things are right now for most workers. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies put it: “The labour market is changing in interesting ways, but not fundamentally (yet).” We can also say that the steady increase in self-employment started before the wide use of digital apps to contract piece work, a hallmark of ‘gig’ industries. The proportion of workers who are self-employed has been rising steadily for about 15 years. We’ve written an introduction to zero hours contracts too. About 2.8% of people with a job don’t have a guarantee that they’ll work a minimum number of hours. About a third of them want more hours and about a third of them consider themselves to be full-time in practice. Many people’s perspectives won’t match the image of the labour market that comes from looking at national averages, as the chief economist of the Bank of England discussed last June. But, at the very least, these aggregates give a wider context for debates about how the job market looks in specific industries or regions, as well as for specific genders, ethnicities, and social classes (however you define them). The Institute for Fiscal Studies has also looked at what's been driving employment growth.","That doesn’t seem to be the case for the UK jobs market overall. The picture for specific industries, regions and groups might be different and statistics will only ever give a limited insight into questions about job quality.

100,fullfact,"Unemployment under Labour rose.

","“Under Labour unemployment rose.” Suella Fernandes MP, 6 April 2017 The number of people unemployed in the UK and the unemployment rate were both higher when Labour left office in 2010 than when it came to power in 1997. That summary hides a varying trend during that time: unemployment was relatively low for most of Labour’s stint, but rose considerably during the recession in the late noughties. When Labour won the 1997 election the unemployment rate for adults was 7.2%. When it left government in 2010, it was 7.9%.  The number of people who were unemployed rose from 2 million to 2.5 million.  Unemployment rates generally fell from the time of Labour taking power in 1997, rising after 2005. During the Labour government unemployment remained at around 5% for most of the 13-year period—in the ballpark of full employment, in practice.  The total number of people unemployed followed roughly the same pattern.  And Labour's time in government ended in a recession, which led to increased unemployment from 2008 onwards.  The main measure of unemployment in the UK is provided by the Labour Force Survey. This looks at “people without a job who have been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks.” It then shows this number as a share of the economically active population.

200,fullfact,"People born poor will die nine years earlier than others.
","""If you're born poor, you will die on average nine years earlier than others."" Theresa May, 13 July 2016 Nine years is the age gap between the life expectancy of men in some of the poorest and wealthiest areas in the UK according to official statistics. The gap is seven years for women. Other studies looking specifically at the impact of deprivation on life expectancy have found similar figures. Life expectancy does vary across the UK Life expectancy for newborn boys in England and Wales was highest in Kensington and Chelsea, at around 83 years. It was lowest in Blackpool at almost 75 years. That’s a difference of almost nine years, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics covering 2012 to 2014. For girls born during the same time, life expectancy is highest in Chiltern in Buckinghamshire, at around 87 years and lowest in Middlesbrough, at just under 80 years. The difference in life expectancies here is almost seven years. In 2014 Kensington and Chelsea, and Buckinghamshire were among the ten areas in the UK with most disposable household income per head. Blackpool is among the twenty areas of the UK with least disposable income, and the South Teesside area containing Middlesbrough is one of the 40 areas with least disposable income. Average life expectancy at birth across England and Wales over this period was 79 for men and 83 for women. Life expectancy is lowest in the North and highest in the South The majority of the top 50 local areas in England and Wales which had the lowest life expectancy for both girls and boys were found in the North East and North West of England and in Wales. The top 50 local areas with the highest life expectancy were almost all in the East Midlands, South East, East of England, South West or London. The link between deprivation and life expectancy A 2015 study by the King’s Fund think tank looked at life expectancy in England from 1999 to 2003 and 2006 to 2010. It found that the majority of areas with persistently low life expectancy during this time also had a high proportion of people earning low or no wages. It also found that the reverse was largely true. Other studies have found similar links. The Marmot Review commissioned by the Secretary of State for Health in 2008 said that average life expectancy was seven years lower in the poorest communities compared to the wealthiest. When this review looked at disability-free life expectancy this gap widened to 17 years. These studies looked specifically at the link between life expectancy and income deprivation, whereas the ONS figures which looked at disposable income. The King’s Fund found that a number of other factors affected life expectancy, including deprivation in old age, housing deprivation, binge drinking, fruit and vegetable consumption and gender.","This is partially correct. Boys born in some of the poorest areas in the UK are expected to live nine years fewer than those in the very richest areas. For girls the figure is seven years.

201,fullfact,"Life expectancy in the UK is falling.
","“Shortchanged: Why British Life Expectancy Is Falling “For the first time in modern history, Britons are living shorter lives, with poor lifestyles, depression and budget cuts the leading causes.” New York Times, 30 August 2019 This (since corrected) headline from the New York Times is incorrect. Overall life expectancy in the UK is not falling, but it is stalling.  Life expectancy in the UK has been rising for well over a century, and in recent years that growth has slowed down considerably and has almost stopped. If you dig beneath those national figures, you can find cases of falling life expectancy in certain local authorities, including in Hartlepool—which the New York Times drew attention to in its piece. The New York Times changed its headline after we contacted them and it now correctly reads that life expectancy has stalled. There are two ways of measuring life expectancy: called “cohort” and “period”. Cohort life expectancy tries to project how long you will live by observing current mortality rates and projecting how those rates will improve over time. It’s regarded as the most realistic number for how long you’re actually expected to live. Current cohort projections suggest a man born in the UK today has a life expectancy of nearly 90 years, while a woman’s life expectancy would be over 94 years. You can find out your own life expectancy in this way using this Office for National Statistics (ONS) calculator. A less tangible but still useful figure is period life expectancy. This just looks at the year you’re born in and assumes that year’s mortality rates apply throughout your life. So it’s a lower number because it’s not taking into account the likelihood that your life expectancy will go up as you get older, because in general we’re getting healthier, medicine is getting more sophisticated, and we’re living longer as a population. But it has the advantage of being a more certain figure (it doesn’t have to guess what the future holds) and it tells us a bit more about what’s happening to people’s health and wellbeing right now. These are the figures featured by the New York Times. On this measure, according to the ONS: “Life expectancy at birth in the UK did not improve in 2015 to 2017 and remained at 79.2 years for males and 82.9 years for females.” If you look at the trend over time in those figures, both male and female life expectancies rose slowly until about 2014, and they haven’t discernibly changed since.  In this section we’ll use “period” life expectancy figures, as these are better for showing us what’s happening to the UK today. Different parts of the UK have seen different trends which don’t follow the national picture. For example, life expectancy at birth fell slightly for both sexes in the most recent figures for Scotland and Wales, and for men in Northern Ireland. As the New York Times focuses on, Hartlepool has also seen falls. Hartlepool has seen the steepest fall in male life expectancy of any local authority in the UK over roughly the last three years. It was 77.6 years around 2012-2014 and was 76.1 years in 2015-2017. For women the drop is much less pronounced: it was 81.6 in 2012-2014 and 81.4 in 2015-2017. Even those figures are for Hartlepool overall, and there’s further evidence that neighbourhoods within the town differ a great deal. According to data from Public Health England, the gap in life expectancy between the most and least deprived areas of the town is 11.7 years for men and 10.2 years for women. In one sense these falls don’t sound very big—but any fall in life expectancy is fairly unprecedented in the wider context of UK trends for over a century, and the stalls or falls in recent years have prompted debate over what’s causing them.","Incorrect. Growth in overall life expectancy has slowed down and almost stopped after over a century of increases. Life expectancies are falling in certain local authorities within the UK.

As a result, he added, “Teesside men have the same life expectancy of those in Ethiopia”. Alex Cunningham’s office told us that this figure came from a BBC report about the large life expectancy gap within Stockton-on-Tees. This mentions Stockton Town Centre, a ward in Mr Cunningham’s constituency where male life expectancy is 64. The BBC article is correct, although the figure has since risen to 65. This is about the same figure that the World Bank recorded for men in Ethiopia in 2017. UK life expectancy figures are not published by constituency, but men in the London borough of Hillingdon, which contains the prime minister’s constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, have a life expectancy of 80.4. That’s about 15 or 16 years higher than the ward in Stockton. Mr Cunningham’s office said they chose 14 as a conservative estimate because the BBC article was slightly dated. It’s worth bearing in mind that these figures don’t mean that men are predicted to live as long as 64 or 80.4 years in these areas, because health and mortality rates are usually expected to improve by the time men born today reach these ages. A life expectancy of 64 is extremely low for the UK, where the latest average for men is 79.3, so it is understandable that Mr Cunningham and the BBC would want to bring Stockton Town Centre to public attention. However, the adult population there makes up less than a tenth of registered voters in Stockton North, so Mr Cunningham is wrong to suggest that their story represents his constituency in general, let alone Teesside as a whole. In fact, men in the borough of Stockton-on-Tees have an average life expectancy of 78.1, just two years less than in Hillingdon and 14 more than in Ethiopia.  In his reply, Boris Johnson called the discrepancy in life expectancy in the UK “a disgrace”. “But it is coming down and it will come down,” he added. It is not clear whether the Prime Minister had in mind the discrepancy in life expectancy between rich and poor, or between the North East and London, but he is wrong in either case. Life expectancy in the North East continues to rise more slowly than it does in London, widening the gap between them all the time. Measuring the life expectancy gap by income is more complicated, but analysis by scientists on the Longevity Science Panel shows that it was widening, at least until 2015, which is the most recent data in the analysis. It is true that UK life expectancy is at an all-time high, but it is now rising much more slowly than it has in the past, and at different rates for different people.

The number of children in poverty has risen since 2010, and now stands at 4 million.
","“The last Labour Government took 800,000 children out of poverty…” Jeremy Corbyn, 30 November 2016 That’s correct by one reasonable measure. But there are many different measures of poverty. Mr Corbyn is talking about the number of children in relative poverty, which fell by about 800,000 between 1997/98 and 2009/10, not taking housing costs into account. It’s also reasonable to consider incomes when housing costs are included. By that measure, the number of children in relative poverty fell by less over the same period. It fell by about 300,000. Households in relative poverty have an income that’s less than 60% of the middle-earning household—in other words, they’re poor relative to other households in the UK.  This can sometimes lead to counter-intuitive conclusions. For example, it would be a bit odd to say that a family was lifted out of poverty simply because other families on the street got poorer. Another measure is absolute poverty, which the government defines as having an income less than 60% of the middle-earner in 2010/11. By that measure, the number of children in poverty fell even more under New Labour. About 2.7 million fewer children were living in absolute poverty by the end of the last Labour government, or 2.1 million fewer if you take housing costs into account. “...Under her government child poverty is rising and now covers 4 million children across the country.” Jeremy Corbyn, 30 November 2016 It’s also correct that the best estimate for the number of children in relative poverty has risen since 2010. It’s not risen by enough to say, with confidence, that we’re seeing a real change in poverty rather than a chance variation in the estimate. On the other hand, the estimate has risen consistently each year. It was down to 3.6 million in 2010. It now stands at 3.9 million. “We are seeing fewer families in absolute poverty and fewer families in relative poverty.” Theresa May, 30 November 2016 We’ve asked No. 10 which time period Mrs. May is referring to here. If you look at the trends  since the 2010 election, it’s wrong to say that the number of families living in relative poverty is falling.  The government’s best estimate for both the number of children and the number of individuals in relatively poor households increased between 2010/11 and 2014/15, whether you look at it before or after housing costs. On the other hand, it’s true that the DWP’s best estimate for the number of people living in absolute poverty has fallen slightly since 2010/11, having peaked in 2012/13. Again, that’s the case whether you take housing costs into account or not. The best estimate for the number of children in absolute poverty has remained broadly stable over the same time period. Again, none of these changes are large enough to say for certain that we’re seeing a real change in poverty rather than a chance variation in the estimate. It gets easier to spot trends in the figures if you look at longer time periods, so we’ve looked at the long term trends in our poverty guide.

Broadly correct, if you look at the number of children living in relative poverty and don’t include housing costs. This hasn’t been a statistically significant rise, and there’s more than one measure of poverty.

The last labour government took 800,000 children out of poverty.
","“The last Labour Government took 800,000 children out of poverty…” Jeremy Corbyn, 30 November 2016 That’s correct by one reasonable measure. But there are many different measures of poverty. Mr Corbyn is talking about the number of children in relative poverty, which fell by about 800,000 between 1997/98 and 2009/10, not taking housing costs into account. It’s also reasonable to consider incomes when housing costs are included. By that measure, the number of children in relative poverty fell by less over the same period. It fell by about 300,000. Households in relative poverty have an income that’s less than 60% of the middle-earning household—in other words, they’re poor relative to other households in the UK.  This can sometimes lead to counter-intuitive conclusions. For example, it would be a bit odd to say that a family was lifted out of poverty simply because other families on the street got poorer. Another measure is absolute poverty, which the government defines as having an income less than 60% of the middle-earner in 2010/11. By that measure, the number of children in poverty fell even more under New Labour. About 2.7 million fewer children were living in absolute poverty by the end of the last Labour government, or 2.1 million fewer if you take housing costs into account. “...Under her government child poverty is rising and now covers 4 million children across the country.” Jeremy Corbyn, 30 November 2016 It’s also correct that the best estimate for the number of children in relative poverty has risen since 2010. It’s not risen by enough to say, with confidence, that we’re seeing a real change in poverty rather than a chance variation in the estimate. On the other hand, the estimate has risen consistently each year. It was down to 3.6 million in 2010. It now stands at 3.9 million. “We are seeing fewer families in absolute poverty and fewer families in relative poverty.” Theresa May, 30 November 2016 We’ve asked No. 10 which time period Mrs. May is referring to here. If you look at the trends  since the 2010 election, it’s wrong to say that the number of families living in relative poverty is falling.  The government’s best estimate for both the number of children and the number of individuals in relatively poor households increased between 2010/11 and 2014/15, whether you look at it before or after housing costs. On the other hand, it’s true that the DWP’s best estimate for the number of people living in absolute poverty has fallen slightly since 2010/11, having peaked in 2012/13. Again, that’s the case whether you take housing costs into account or not. The best estimate for the number of children in absolute poverty has remained broadly stable over the same time period. Again, none of these changes are large enough to say for certain that we’re seeing a real change in poverty rather than a chance variation in the estimate. It gets easier to spot trends in the figures if you look at longer time periods, so we’ve looked at the long term trends in our poverty guide.

It depends how you look at it and what time period you pick. If you take the claim to be referring to the period since 2010, that’s incorrect. The number of children or people living in relative poverty has risen since then, whether or not you include housing costs.

56,fullfact,"23% of people in Wales live in poverty
"," “We have got 23% of people living in poverty here in Wales.” Leanne Wood AM, 23 March 2017 This is correct using the relative measure of poverty, and absolute poverty is similar, estimated at 22%. 23% of people in Wales lived in a household where the income is below 60% of the UK median between 2013/14 and 2015/16. That’s including housing costs, and is roughly 700,000 people. These levels have been roughly the same for the past decade, and slightly higher than other UK countries. The most recent figure for England is 22%, 20% for Northern Ireland and 19% for Scotland. An alternative measure is absolute poverty. This is where, instead of comparing people relative to the rest of the population, people are measured against a fixed standard of living. The government chooses to use the relative poverty line in 2010/11, adjusted for inflation. 22% of people in Wales lived in absolute poverty between 2013/14 and 2015/16. Again, that’s including housing costs and about 700,000 people. It’s still higher than 21% in England, 20% in Northern Ireland and 18% in Scotland. For both relative and absolute measures, the figures before housing costs are taken into account are a little bit lower. There are issues with using both absolute and relative measures of poverty to understand inequality in the UK. If you are interested, take a look at our piece here.   This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time.

57,fullfact,"Child poverty increased by 250,000 in a single year under the Conservatives.
","“Number of children in poverty increased by 250,000 under Conservatives, figures show” Independent, 1 October 2016 “The number of kids living in poor households soared by 250,000 in a single year of Tory-led Government, damning new stats show.” Mirror, 30 September 2016 This is correct. The number of children living in low-income families increased from around 2.5 million to almost 2.75 million across the UK between 2013 and 2014 under the Coalition government, according to HM Revenue and Customs. This is an increase from just over 18% of all children (or at least, all children in families receiving Child Benefit) to 20%. But the number and proportion of children in poverty according to this measure has been broadly stable since the change of government in 2010. These children are in families receiving certain benefits such as Jobseeker’s Allowance or Child Tax Credit. They often have an income which is considerably below the average. Although the percentage of children in low-income families increased by 2% on the previous year, it’s a return to the levels found in 2010. Around 2.8 million children, or 21%, lived in low-income families in the year the Coalition government was elected, according to HMRC. Rather than being a figure for the whole year, this is just the number who were classed as being in low-income families on a single day in August. A family is said by HMRC to have a low income if they receive Jobseeker’s Allowance or Income Support, or if they get Child Tax Credit or Working Tax Credit and their income is 60% less than the median income. The median income is the income in the middle if you lined up every family’s income in the UK. The proportion of children in low-income families is calculated by dividing the number of children in families receiving these welfare payments by the number of children in families receiving Child Benefit. This is rather than using some other measure such as the census or birth records to calculate how many children there are in the UK. HMRC say that  using Child Benefit figures to count children is “the most comprehensive assessment of the number of children available at the local level.” The most recent estimate is that around 95% of all eligible children and young people have Child Benefit claimed on their behalf. But HMRC also points out that changes to the way Child Benefit was awarded in 2013 mean that “the measure may not be as complete as it has been previously due to families with higher incomes no longer claiming Child Benefit.” The trend isn’t consistent across all families measured to have a low income. The percentage of children defined as being in low-income families because the family receives Income Support or Jobseeker’s Allowance has been decreasing. In 2014 this was 1.87 million or 68% of all children in low-income families. In 2010 it had been 2.23 million or nearly 80%. In comparison the proportion of children in families receiving Child Tax Credit and/or Working Tax Credit, and who have an income below 60% of the median, has increased. Not all of the families listed as receiving Income Support or Jobseeker’s Allowance have a low income. HMRC says that it doesn’t have information about the incomes of the whole group, so the figure includes all families who receive these two welfare payments, not just those who earn less than 60% of the average. HMRC says the rise is down to an increase in the number of families earning 60% less than the median, not because families with children are getting poorer. The threshold below which a family is considered to have a low income went from £334 a week to £387 (for a couple with two children) between 2013 and 2014. For a single parent with two children it went from £262 to £304 over the same time. As ever, there are different ways of measuring child poverty. The data reported by the Independent and the Mirror looks at figures from HMRC. If you look at data on child poverty from the Department of Work and Pensions the figures are slightly different and are measured across the whole year, rather than on a single day. But since 2010 the level of child poverty has remained fairly stable whichever way you measure it. We’ve looked into poverty across age groups here.   Update 17 October 2016 We updated this piece to clarify that not all children and young people are eligible for Child Benefit.  ","This is correct by one measure. According to HMRC the number of children in poverty went from 18% to 20% between 2013 and 2014, an increase of 250,000 children. This is a return to 2010 levels.

58,fullfact,"Muslim women are three times as likely to be unemployed, and twice as likely not to be in the jobs market in the first place, compared to women generally.
","“Muslim women are the most economically disadvantaged group in British society, according to a report by MPs. They are three times more likely to be unemployed and looking for a job than women generally and more than twice as likely to be economically inactive, the Women and Equalities Committee said.” BBC News, 11 August 2016 These figures are all correct, according to official data. Muslim women are far more likely to be unemployed than women generally The report published today by MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee doesn’t actually say that Muslim women are three times more likely to be unemployed. But their inquiry was given figures by the Department for Work and Pensions, published separately, which show that the unemployment rate in that group was 16% in 2015. The unemployment rate refers to the proportion of those in work, plus those seeking and available to work, who are unemployed. Everyone else—people who aren’t seeking or available for work at all—are termed ‘economically inactive’. The unemployment rate for all women (aged 16 and up) in the same year was around 5%. Muslim men were less likely to be unemployed than Muslim women, but were still twice as likely to be out of work as men generally. In both cases, the unemployment rate has been falling over the last five years, but that’s also been the case among the population generally. It’s fallen by about one third among Muslim women and all women, so the gap hasn’t narrowed.  Higher unemployment for Muslim women can’t entirely be explained by things like English language skills, education levels or religious objections to working certain jobs, according to a study carried out at the University of Bristol in 2015. That found that Muslim women were 71% more likely than white Christian women to be unemployed, even comparing women with similar language abilities, education, marital status, number of children and strength of religious belief. The author, Dr Nabil Khattab,  suggests that this could be attributed to discrimination. That’s backed up by studies showing that CVs sent out under ethnic minority names are less likely to result in an interview offer, even if the qualifications and experience listed are similar to other applications. Muslim women are also less likely to be seeking or available for work in the first place The BBC is correct that Muslim women are twice as likely to be out of the labour market—'economic inactivity' again—although this also isn’t a point made specifically in today’s report. 58% of all Muslim women were economically inactive in 2015, compared to 27% of all women. A major reason for this is to look after the home or family, in the case of Muslims, whereas only a small proportion of women nationally give this as a reason, according to analysis of the 2011 census by the think tank Demos.","This is correct.

Jeremy Corbyn, 29 September 2015 Jeremy Corbyn said today, in his speech to the Labour Party Conference, that ""one in seven"" of those in the labour force are self-employed. This morning the shadow Education Secretary, Lucy Powell, reportedly claimed that the number is ""growing"". One in seven is right, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Its latest figures show that just over 31 million people are employed, of which 4.5 million work for themselves. That's around 14.5% of all workers, or one in seven (measuring over May-July 2015). Is the number of self-employed people ""growing""? Well, yes, that is the broad trend over the past few years, although it's fluctuated a bit. But the population and the number of workers have also increased over the years, so it's not altogether surprising that so has the number of self-employed people. More to the point is whether the proportion is growing. Was that one in seven previously one in eight? That depends on where you measure from. In the same period a year ago, to take one point of reference, the proportion of self-employed people was slightly higher than it is now, at 14.9%. Over the longer term, the proportion does seem to be on the rise. When David Cameron was first elected Prime Minister, for instance, the proportion was 13.5%. The lowest point back to 1992, when the figures start, was at the end of 2000 when it was 11.7%. That's almost one in nine people. Here's the chart—decide for yourself what it shows.  The ONS has also published analysis comparing back to earlier figures, finding in 2014 that the proportion of workers who were self-employed (15% over the year) was higher than at any point over the past 40 years. Update 29 September 2015 We added in the last sentence to reference the 2014 ONS analysis.","One in seven is right, and the number and proportion of workers that are self-employed has been rising since the early 2000s, although it has fluctuated.

60,fullfact,"One third of private rented homes don't meet basic health and safety standards.
","""A third of private rented homes are not meeting basic standards of health and safety"" Jeremy Corbyn, 28 September 2015 In his first speech to the Labour party conference as leader, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that a third of all private rented homes don't meet basic health and safety standards. This isn't quite accurate. It's true that just under a third of private rented homes don't meet the government's Decent Home Standard, but minimum health and safety standards are just one of four criteria which a property has to meet in order for it to be considered 'decent'. If we're talking about health and safety alone, 17% of private rented homes don't meet the minimum standard. So more like a sixth than a third. Health and safety is just one of four criteria for 'decent' homes You may have your own views on the matter, but the government actually has a standard definition. For a home to be decent it needs to: 1. Meet the statutory minimum health and safety standard Councils use the Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) to assess for 'Category 1' hazards. These are the most serious examples of hazards such as dampness and mould, unsafe electrical wiring and poor hygiene among others. 2. Be in a reasonable state of repair Based on the structural integrity of the building and the need for repair works. 3. Have reasonably modern facilities Homes which fail to meet this condition lack at least three of the following: a kitchen no older than 20 years, bathrooms no older than 30 years, good noise insulation and a sensible layout (in various areas of the property). 4. Provide a reasonable amount of heating This includes adequate insulation and a functional heating system. Of the private rented homes failing to meet the Decent Homes Standard in 2013, 55% contained at least one Category 1 hazard, 45% did not provide a reasonable amount of heating, 23% were in a state of disrepair and 11% lacked modern facilities. Private rental homes perform worse than other types on safety and decency The government's English Housing Survey distinguishes between four types of tenure: owner occupied, private rented, local authority and housing association. The last two are sometime taken together as 'social rented', as we've done in our graphs below. Although private rented homes are more likely to have a Category 1 hazard than others—17% compared with a cross-tenure average of 12%—standards have been improving. Between 2008 and 2013, the proportion of private rented stock with a Category 1 hazard fell from 31% to 17%.  The Housing Survey puts these improvements down to the government's drive to improve housing standards in the social rented sector and increased local authority enforcement against landlords in the private rental sector, as well as homes across all tenures becoming more energy efficient (which can reduce the risk of excess cold). Looking at the wider assessment of a home as 'decent', as opposed to safe, the picture is similar: private rented homes perform worse compared to other tenures, but there has been improvement across the board.  One possible explanation relates to the age of housing stock. The private rented sector has the highest proportion of pre-1919 housing stock compared with other tenures, and generally speaking, the older a building gets, the more prone it is to disrepair. While this is true for all tenures, private rented homes also require more repairs than any other tenure for homes of similar age—at least for properties built before 1964. For more modern homes, social rented housing needs more repairs than private rented.","Close to a third of private rented properties don't meet the official Decent Homes Standard, but health and safety is only one possible reason a home can fail that. A sixth of private rental homes failed minimum health and safety standards in 2013.

94,fullfact,"Cuts to tax credits will cost low-paid working families £1,300 a year.
","""The Tory conference was a feast of spin and deception. Fake claims to be on the side of working people while robbing three million low paid families of £1,300 a year with the Tax Credit cuts."" Jeremy Corbyn, 9 October 2015 Upcoming changes to working tax credit will reduce the incomes of all households that currently receive it. Fewer will be eligible, and those who continue to receive it will be entitled to less than they would have been. In the year from April 2016 working households are set to lose around £1,300 on average, according to a ""rough estimate"" by the House of Commons Library. That's based on spreading the expected £4.4 billion reduction in spending over the 3.3 million working households that currently receive tax credits. Some families will be more affected by this than others. The biggest reductions will be for the current recipients with the highest incomes. The government has argued that the important thing is to look at the cuts as part of a wider package of changes, most prominently a higher minimum wage and personal tax threshold. Tax credits are being reduced At the moment each household gets a maximum amount in working tax credit depending on its circumstances (for instance whether it contains children or a disabled adult), and on hours worked. Once a household's income rises above £6,420 a year, the amount is reduced from that maximum by 41%. So for every £100 extra earned, £41 of working tax credit is taken away. From April, only those earning £3,850 or less will be entitled to the maximum amount. And that amount is to be frozen, meaning its spending power will be reduced. For those earning more than the threshold, reductions will now be at 48% instead of 41%. The more a household earns, the bigger the total reduction in their working tax credit—some of the highest earning recipients will no longer be entitled to it at all. Child tax credit is also set to change. The income claimants can have before they start to see payments reduced will fall from £16,105 to £12,125, and the rate of reduction will also rise from 41% to 48%. And from April 2017 new claimants won't get the ""family element"" part of the credit and will only receive payments for their first two children. Average cuts to working families of roughly £1,300 each The Office for Budget Responsibility predicts savings of £4.4 billion from the lower thresholds and the increase in the rate of reduction of working tax credit (from 41% to 48%). That doesn't include the changes that affect new claimants only. The House of Commons Library has divided that £4.4 billion between the 3.3 million working families who receive tax credits to arrive at the £1,300 estimate. That calculation assumes that the savings will fall predominantly on working families. The thinking is that the reduction in the child tax credit threshold will affect very few non-working families, because not many will be earning above £12,125 anyway. In practice we don't know how many will be affected. As the Library points out, less than 3% of such families earn more than the current threshold of £16,105. What we don't know is how many are earning between £12,125 and £16,105 and so will receive less in child tax credit. That's one of the reasons the Library has been careful to emphasise that the estimate is a rough one.","£1,300 is a ""rough"" estimate of the average reduction in income next year (2016/17).

If women in the UK reached their full economic potential it would be worth £23 billion. 
","Last week, we looked at some of the claims the new Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell made on BBC Question Time. As promised, we've looked at some of the other claims made in the same broadcast. This time we've taken an exchange between Environment Minister Elizabeth Truss, and broadcaster and Women's Equality Party co-founder Sandi Toksvig on the economic fortunes of women. ""...If you unleash the full potential of women in this country it would be worth £23 billion"" Sandi Toksvig The Women's Equality Party has told us this comes from a 2009 report by the Women and Work Commission. Its estimate, made in 2006, was that reducing the gender segregation of jobs and increasing women's employment could be worth £15-£23 billion (or 1.3-2% of GDP). It's hard to say whether these were reasonable estimates at the time as the report didn't lay out all of the calculations used to reach the figures. Overall it's possibly not wise to treat decade old figures as currently applicable. For instance, the pay gap has shrunk over that period and women's employment rates have risen, so some of the gains envisaged by the Commission may already have been achieved. On the other hand, the the economy has grown and prices have risen. Some of these gains will increase with the size of the economy and the number of workers who can move to more productive jobs, and higher prices mean that the cash figures would be higher in today's money. ""...We have more women in work than ever before"" Elizabeth Truss This is true. In June 2015, there were 14.6 million women in employment in the UK, and  there were 26.6 million women over the age of 16 in the UK household population. Both of these figures were at record highs, just as they were in most months in the last year. The number of women in employment was at a record high in 11 of the last 12 months, and the number of women in the country was at a record high in all 12. The employment rate—the proportion of working age women who are employed— was also at a  at 69%, partly due to changes to state pension ages. The employment rate is calculated for women aged from 16 to 64. As the state pension age for women rises from 60 to 65, women are likely to work longer. That increases the employment rate. The employment rate is a more meaningful measure of how well we're doing getting women into work. The population is growing, and as it does so the number of people in employment will tend to grow with it (barring exceptional periods like the recession). ""...The gender pay gap is lower than it's ever been before"" Elizabeth Truss This is true. The pay gap is at record lows for full-time employees and for employees overall. This followed a long term trend and it's not necessarily the case that the fall was driven by recent government action. Many of the factors behind changes in the pay gap—like higher levels of university education and work experience—are the result of decisions taken decades ago. The Office for National Statistics measures the pay gap by looking at the difference between what the middle earning man and woman get paid before taxes.

There are more women in the UK in work than ever before. 
","Last week, we looked at some of the claims the new Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell made on BBC Question Time. As promised, we've looked at some of the other claims made in the same broadcast. This time we've taken an exchange between Environment Minister Elizabeth Truss, and broadcaster and Women's Equality Party co-founder Sandi Toksvig on the economic fortunes of women. ""...If you unleash the full potential of women in this country it would be worth £23 billion"" Sandi Toksvig The Women's Equality Party has told us this comes from a 2009 report by the Women and Work Commission. Its estimate, made in 2006, was that reducing the gender segregation of jobs and increasing women's employment could be worth £15-£23 billion (or 1.3-2% of GDP). It's hard to say whether these were reasonable estimates at the time as the report didn't lay out all of the calculations used to reach the figures. Overall it's possibly not wise to treat decade old figures as currently applicable. For instance, the pay gap has shrunk over that period and women's employment rates have risen, so some of the gains envisaged by the Commission may already have been achieved. On the other hand, the the economy has grown and prices have risen. Some of these gains will increase with the size of the economy and the number of workers who can move to more productive jobs, and higher prices mean that the cash figures would be higher in today's money. ""...We have more women in work than ever before"" Elizabeth Truss This is true. In June 2015, there were 14.6 million women in employment in the UK, and  there were 26.6 million women over the age of 16 in the UK household population. Both of these figures were at record highs, just as they were in most months in the last year. The number of women in employment was at a record high in 11 of the last 12 months, and the number of women in the country was at a record high in all 12. The employment rate—the proportion of working age women who are employed— was also at a  at 69%, partly due to changes to state pension ages. The employment rate is calculated for women aged from 16 to 64. As the state pension age for women rises from 60 to 65, women are likely to work longer. That increases the employment rate. The employment rate is a more meaningful measure of how well we're doing getting women into work. The population is growing, and as it does so the number of people in employment will tend to grow with it (barring exceptional periods like the recession). ""...The gender pay gap is lower than it's ever been before"" Elizabeth Truss This is true. The pay gap is at record lows for full-time employees and for employees overall. This followed a long term trend and it's not necessarily the case that the fall was driven by recent government action. Many of the factors behind changes in the pay gap—like higher levels of university education and work experience—are the result of decisions taken decades ago. The Office for National Statistics measures the pay gap by looking at the difference between what the middle earning man and woman get paid before taxes. Its preferred measure (for full-time employees) of the gap put it at 9.4% in 2014, while for employees overall it sat at 19.1%. For part-time workers, the pay gap didn't change significantly and in fact it's actually widened over the long term. However, for part-time workers the pay gap is negative: the median earning woman earns more than the median earning man.

800,000 of the ""2 million jobs created"" are zero hour contracts. 
","John McDonnell argued on last night's BBC Question Time that some of the government's economic boasts are hollow. He said that there'd been a rise in zero hours contracts, falling real wages and a million families dependent on food banks. We've taken a look at his claims. ""The two million jobs that have just been mentioned, 800,000 of them are on zero hours contracts."" We have no way of knowing how much of the increase in employment over the last Parliament—which the two million jobs refers to—came from people on zero hour contracts. The 800,000 figure might be a reference to the latest estimate for the number of people with zero hour contracts as their main job, which is a bit lower at 744,000. This was just the number of people on zero hour contracts at one point in time, not an estimate of the increase in the number of people on these contracts. We can't accurately say how the number of people on zero hours contracts has changed over time. The estimates of the number of people on these contracts come from a survey, and have been affected by growing awareness of zero hours contracts. As zero hour contracts have gained public attention, people might simply be more likely to be aware that they're on them and so more likely to report being on them. The only zero hours contract figures we can compare over time—which come from asking employers how many of the contracts they have—give us data just for the number of zero hour contracts, rather than the number of people on them. They also only give us data for the change from January 2014 to January 2015. The two million jobs claim refers to the increase of people in employment since the election—a rise of two million people from the three months before the 2010 election to May to July 2015. Comparing an increase in the number of zero hours contracts with the increase in people in work is problematic because one person can be on more than one zero hour contract. That's aside from the problem that the zero hour contracts comparison doesn't stretch back as far as the election.   The increase in the number of zero hour contracts was 91,000 contracts between 2014 and 2015 (a 6% increase from 1.4 million to 1.5 million contracts). This increase was not statistically significant. ""Our wages now are less than they were before the economic crisis"" Average weekly earnings (including bonuses) were lower in July 2015 than they were just before the 2008 recession, after accounting for inflation and seasonal movements in pay.   Adjusted for inflation, the average worker earned £520 a week in December 2007, whereas they earned £496 a week in July this year.  This figure doesn't include the earnings of self-employed people, who make up about 15% of people in work. Average weekly earnings can change because people are taking different jobs. Using a slightly different dataset, the Office for National Statistics has found that pay for employees in low, medium and high-skilled occupations has fallen more than pay overall, and that employment shifting towards high skilled occupations, which pay more, reduced the overall drop. You can read more about changes in high-skilled jobs here. ""We have a million families dependent on food banks in this country"" The most commonly used figures for food bank use come from the Trussell Trust. It was previously reported that over a million people—not families—used its food banks in 2014/15. What the Trust actually meant was that its food banks provided for the equivalent of about one million people using a food bank once each over that year. There were one million uses of Trussell Trust food banks last year, not one million people using them. The Trussell Trust describes its service as ""emergency food and support"", not sustained food provision. About half of the Trust's users only needed one food bank voucher in a year and only 15% used the service more than three times in a year. On average, the Trust says its users needed two food bank vouchers annually, so the number of people using its food banks is likely to be around half of the 1.1 million figure.  The Trussell Trust isn't the only organisation running food banks in the UK, so we don't have an overall figure for the total number of people, or families, fed by food aid providers. The Trust runs 445 food banks, while the total number of food banks that exist may be around 800 or more. It's not possible to extrapolate from the Trust's figures to the number of people using all food banks in the UK as it's not clear whether other food banks have similar patterns of use, similar referral systems, or operate on a similar scale to the Trussell Trust. But using the Trussell Trust figures,  it's wrong to say that a million families use food banks. Update 21 September 2015 Two sentences were added to explain the number of Trussell Trust food banks and the total number of food banks overall, and to say that it is not possible to extrapolate from the Trussell Trust data to all food banks.

62,fullfact,"A million families are dependent on food banks. 
","John McDonnell argued on last night's BBC Question Time that some of the government's economic boasts are hollow. He said that there'd been a rise in zero hours contracts, falling real wages and a million families dependent on food banks. We've taken a look at his claims. ""The two million jobs that have just been mentioned, 800,000 of them are on zero hours contracts."" We have no way of knowing how much of the increase in employment over the last Parliament—which the two million jobs refers to—came from people on zero hour contracts. The 800,000 figure might be a reference to the latest estimate for the number of people with zero hour contracts as their main job, which is a bit lower at 744,000. This was just the number of people on zero hour contracts at one point in time, not an estimate of the increase in the number of people on these contracts. We can't accurately say how the number of people on zero hours contracts has changed over time. The estimates of the number of people on these contracts come from a survey, and have been affected by growing awareness of zero hours contracts. As zero hour contracts have gained public attention, people might simply be more likely to be aware that they're on them and so more likely to report being on them. The only zero hours contract figures we can compare over time—which come from asking employers how many of the contracts they have—give us data just for the number of zero hour contracts, rather than the number of people on them. They also only give us data for the change from January 2014 to January 2015. The two million jobs claim refers to the increase of people in employment since the election—a rise of two million people from the three months before the 2010 election to May to July 2015. Comparing an increase in the number of zero hours contracts with the increase in people in work is problematic because one person can be on more than one zero hour contract. That's aside from the problem that the zero hour contracts comparison doesn't stretch back as far as the election.   The increase in the number of zero hour contracts was 91,000 contracts between 2014 and 2015 (a 6% increase from 1.4 million to 1.5 million contracts). This increase was not statistically significant. ""Our wages now are less than they were before the economic crisis"" Average weekly earnings (including bonuses) were lower in July 2015 than they were just before the 2008 recession, after accounting for inflation and seasonal movements in pay.   Adjusted for inflation, the average worker earned £520 a week in December 2007, whereas they earned £496 a week in July this year.  This figure doesn't include the earnings of self-employed people, who make up about 15% of people in work. Average weekly earnings can change because people are taking different jobs. Using a slightly different dataset, the Office for National Statistics has found that pay for employees in low, medium and high-skilled occupations has fallen more than pay overall, and that employment shifting towards high skilled occupations, which pay more, reduced the overall drop. You can read more about changes in high-skilled jobs here. ""We have a million families dependent on food banks in this country"" The most commonly used figures for food bank use come from the Trussell Trust. It was previously reported that over a million people—not families—used its food banks in 2014/15. What the Trust actually meant was that its food banks provided for the equivalent of about one million people using a food bank once each over that year. There were one million uses of Trussell Trust food banks last year, not one million people using them. The Trussell Trust describes its service as ""emergency food and support"", not sustained food provision. About half of the Trust's users only needed one food bank voucher in a year and only 15% used the service more than three times in a year. On average, the Trust says its users needed two food bank vouchers annually, so the number of people using its food banks is likely to be around half of the 1.1 million figure.  The Trussell Trust isn't the only organisation running food banks in the UK, so we don't have an overall figure for the total number of people, or families, fed by food aid providers. The Trust runs 445 food banks, while the total number of food banks that exist may be around 800 or more. It's not possible to extrapolate from the Trust's figures to the number of people using all food banks in the UK as it's not clear whether other food banks have similar patterns of use, similar referral systems, or operate on a similar scale to the Trussell Trust. But using the Trussell Trust figures,  it's wrong to say that a million families use food banks. Update 21 September 2015 Two sentences were added to explain the number of Trussell Trust food banks and the total number of food banks overall, and to say that it is not possible to extrapolate from the Trussell Trust data to all food banks. A sentence from the article was also added to the 'verdict' to say that we don't have an overall figure for the total number of people fed by food aid providers.","The most commonly used figures for food bank use come from the Trussell Trust.

63,fullfact,"Poverty is being redefined to remove any reference to income.
","""Is it true @equalitytrust @FullFact - legislation now going through Parliament will 'redefine' poverty, to remove any reference to income??"" Via Twitter, 3 December 2015 Successive governments have sought to reduce child poverty. At the moment the government judges its progress on this goal using a number of poverty measures which are based predominantly on the income of children's families. The welfare bill currently going through Parliament would replace these with a range of ""life chances measures"". These include the proportion of children living in workless households and in long-term workless households, and the educational attainment of all pupils and of the most disadvantaged pupils at age 16. In doing so, the bill removes the legal requirement on the government to meet existing targets for child poverty, which were based on income. The official statistics on the income-based measures will still be published, however. The new act removes the existing child poverty targets The income-based targets the government uses at the moment were set by the 2010 Child Poverty Act. They're based on income and material measures of poverty: These targets were due to be met by 2020/21 and the measures they describe have been used as the government's main measures of poverty. The Child Poverty and Social Mobility Commission has said it has ""long been obvious"" that the targets will be missed, and the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) agrees. The new act removes the government's legal duty to meet these targets and removes ""most"" duties and provisions set out in the act. Instead, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions must report annually on the workless households and educational attainment measures. The bill doesn't give targets for these measures. Experts have criticised the removal of low-income working families from the measures. Two-thirds of children in poverty by the current relative poverty measure live in working households.  The government says that the new measures reflect its view that the best route out of poverty is work. We've got more on work and poverty in our factcheck. The income-based measures will continue to be published as part of the annual Households Below Average Income release, aside from persistent poverty which is measured separately. Although the changes in the bill relate to measures of child poverty, the focus on non-income measures will be used for adults too, the government told us. Income-based poverty measures have been criticised by experts The government has criticised the relative income measure because when median income falls, such as during the recession, this can mean that the number of children counted as in poverty falls despite there being ""little change to those children's lives"". It's not just the government who thinks there are drawbacks to focusing on an income measure of poverty. The IFS has said that: ""one risk of fixating too much on current income is that this may skew the political incentives towards policies which have immediate and predictable effects on current incomes, like increasing benefits"". But the complete removal of income from the indicators has been criticised. The IFS recommend supplementing the income measures, rather than getting rid of them. And the Child Poverty and Social Mobility Commission has said: ""The life chances of children, the poorest especially, depend on many things including good parenting, childcare, education and employment. For that reason we welcome the new legal duties on worklessness and educational attainment. It is not credible, however, to try to improve the life chances of the poor without acknowledging the most obvious symptom of poverty, lack of money."" Further measures will be developed The government says it will be developing a range of ""other measures and indicators of root causes of poverty"" alongside the ones in the bill, including family breakdown, and debt and addiction. These will be developed in a new Life Chances Strategy. The bill is going through the House of Lords. For more information about the debates surrounding these changes, take a look at the House of Commons Library's briefing.","A bill going through Parliament contains plans to replace existing income indicators of child poverty with ones that focus on worklessness and educational attainment. The annual statistics on the income measures will still be published but they won't be the government's main poverty indicators.

64,fullfact,"Low-paid workers are trapped in poverty.
","""The extent to which low-paid workers in the UK stay trapped in poverty is highlighted by a report showing only one in four workers who were low-paid in 2001 — and who have remained in employment for most of the subsequent decade — went on to escape poverty and move on to higher pay."" — The Guardian 11/11/2014 Definitions are important. While the workers in this report from the Resolution Foundation may be ""stuck"" in a low-paying job, this doesn't mean that they are in poverty. Absolute and relative poverty Poverty is measured as 'absolute' or 'relative'. Being in absolute poverty means that you can't afford the basic needs of existence. The World Bank uses a fairly typical definition of absolute poverty—an income of less than $1.25 a day. In the UK we normally concentrate on relative poverty, which means that a person can't afford an ""ordinary living pattern""—they're excluded from the activities and opportunities that the average person enjoys. Measures of relative poverty The ONS defines a person as being 'at risk of poverty' if they're part of a household earning less than 60% of the median equivalised disposable household income. The median is the number 'in the middle' of a set—so half of all households earn more than the median income household, and half earn less. ""Equivalised disposable household income"" is total household income after adjusting for the number of people in a home and taking into account taxes paid and benefits received. This 'does not necessarily imply a low standard of living'—it simply means that a household earns a comparatively low income. Low pay, not poverty The report by the Resolution Foundation talked specifically about low pay, which they defined as an hourly wage of less than 66% of the national median. The report didn't give a definition of—or attempt to measure—poverty. The two measures—poverty from the ONS, and low pay from the Resolution Foundation—aren't comparable. They take different percentages (66% and 60%) of completely different figures. Low pay looks at hourly wages, before any taxes are paid or benefits received, while the poverty measure (defined by the ONS) looks at household income after these have been taken into account. So the poverty measure considers the number of people in a house and their combined incomes from all sources. The low pay measure only looks at hourly wages—excluding other income sources and the number of hours worked. While the Resolution Foundation paper is informative about the chances of a person moving out of low pay, it doesn't try to give us an estimate of the number of people in poverty. The report notes that 'one in three low paid workers live in a household in the top half of the income distribution', so these people are unlikely to be in poverty. Similarly, some workers with slightly higher hourly wages may support large families. They wouldn't be in 'low pay', but they would be 'at risk of poverty'. One recent report that did discuss the number of people currently in poverty came from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Not necessarily trapped in poverty The Resolution Foundation report divided workers into two groups. 'Escapers', who saw their wages grow out of the low pay bracket, and 'non-escapers' who didn't. The two groups had similar household incomes at the start of the study, and starting incomes were not found to influence pay progression. The report concluded that ""starting in a lower income household is not strongly linked with becoming stuck on low pay"". Photo courtesy of Luis Felipe Salas","This muddles definitions. The report in question didn't discuss poverty. Although the issues are related, not all low-paid workers are in poverty.

258,fullfact,"Theresa May changed the law to remove protection from Commonwealth citizens and Diane Abbott voted against the change.
","“In 2014 when Theresa May was home secretary she changed the law to remove the protection from Commonwealth citizens, and I voted against that.” Diane Abbott MP, 26 April 2018 Diane Abbott’s office was not immediately able to say which vote she was referring to but she voted seven times on the Immigration Bill in 2014. Six of those votes were on other specific issues. One was voting against the whole Bill. During that debate Diane Abbott asked Theresa May, then Home Secretary and the Minister in charge of the Bill, this question: “has she given no thought to the effect that her measures that are designed to crack down on illegal immigrants could have on people who are British nationals, but appear as if they might be immigrants?” Theresa May’s reply started: “We have given a great deal of thought to the way in which our measures will operate.” She did not mention British nationals specifically and concentrates on the complexity of the system the Bill was designed to change. The Commonwealth, the Caribbean, or the Windrush generation were not mentioned specifically in this debate. The British Nationality Act 1948 made citizens of Commonwealth countries citizens of the UK and Colonies. The Immigration Act 1971 changed the law to grant only temporary residence to most new arrivals, but still allowed people who'd arrived before 1973 to remain in the UK indefinitely. The practical effect of the change in the Immigration Act 2014 is disputed. The government says it didn’t remove protection. In a recent debate the current Home Secretary Amber Rudd said that the exemption from deportation for commonwealth citizens was taken out “because it was not necessary; those people had the rights under the 1971 legislation.” The problem, she argued, was “the information to confirm” that people had those rights.

260,fullfact,"Up to 57,000 Commonwealth-born people who arrived in the UK before 1971 could lose their homes, jobs, benefits, NHS treatment, or be threatened with deportation.
","“Despite having lived here and paid taxes for decades, some [Commonwealth-born people] have lost their homes, jobs and benefits, been denied NHS treatment and been threatened with deportation… Research by academics at the Oxford University-based Migration Observatory suggests that up to 57,000 people who arrived in the UK before 1971 could be subject to such appalling treatment.” Daily Mail, 16 April 2018 People born in Commonwealth countries who arrived in the UK before 1973, and have lived here ever since, have the right to live in the UK indefinitely. This also applies to the wives and children of those people. Many of them are UK citizens. There have been reports that some of those people have lost access to services or potentially faced deportation because they have been unable to prove that they have lived in the UK since before 1973. In June 2017 there were estimated to be 524,000 Commonwealth-born people living in the UK who arrived before 1971, and 57,000 of them self-report as not being UK citizens. This doesn’t tell us how many have faced problems proving their right to be in the UK. These figures are based on the Labour Force Survey (LFS), which provides ""estimates of population characteristics rather than exact measures"". As Commonwealth-born individuals who arrived in the UK before 1971 are a small subset of the LFS, there's more uncertainty around the accuracy of their estimated population size. The government has this week said ""we have some made some mistakes, which we cannot continue to make"". It has also said it doesn’t know of any cases where someone has been deported who had the right to remain in the UK, but it will check through the records to make sure, and a team has been set up to help people “evidence their right to be here and to access the necessary services”. The passing of British Nationality Act 1948 made citizens of Commonwealth countries citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. New immigration rules were introduced in the intervening years, before the Immigration Act 1971 changed the law to grant only temporary residence to most people arriving from Commonwealth countries. This came into force in 1973. However, people born in Commonwealth countries (and their wives and children) who settled in the UK before 1973 were still allowed to remain in the UK indefinitely under the terms of the new Act. They retain that right today. Those who arrived in the UK as citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies between 1948 and 1972 are known as the “Windrush generation”—named after a ship which brought Caribbean workers to the UK in 1948. Some media outlets include only those arriving from the Caribbean in the Windrush generation, while others refer to it as those from all Commonwealth countries. Various media outlets have reported the cases of individuals who arrived in the UK from Caribbean Commonwealth countries as children in 1950s and 60s. Some are now having problems accessing services or face deportation as they don’t have the documents to prove they arrived before 1973. The reports say some individuals are unable to prove their status because they have never applied for a British passport or been formally naturalised, or don’t have complete documentary records of their residence. New immigration rules introduced in 2014 require landlords and the NHS (among others) to see proof of residence in the UK before providing certain services. So some people born in Commonwealth countries may be having to prove their immigration status for the first time, and are encountering problems if they can’t. The Migration Observatory estimates there were 524,000 people living in the UK, in the 12 months to June 2017, who were born in Commonwealth countries and arrived before 1971. Of these, 57,000 said they weren’t UK citizens. However there are limits to what the numbers can tell us. The Migration Observatory says that “These figures do not represent an estimate of the number of people who are now likely to have difficulty demonstrating their legal status in the UK.” That will depend on whether or not they have the necessary documentation. The information on nationality is self-reported—so anyone who mistakenly believes they are a UK citizen will not be included in the 57,000. And those born in the Commonwealth who are UK citizens could also have problems if they have lost their proof of citizenship in the intervening years. The data only records people arriving before 1971, whereas the Immigration Act was introduced in 1973. So anyone arriving in 1971 or 1972 will not be included in the data. The data also excludes citizens of Malta and Cyprus (which are in the Commonwealth), as they have the right to live in the UK as EU citizens. It also doesn’t count people who live in places like care homes. Correction 23 April 2018  We changed the headline from ""Windrush generation: over half a million in the UK"" to ""Windrush generation: what's the situation?"", because the half a million figure refers to all those people born in the Commonwealth who arrived in the UK before 1971, not those who arrived from Commonwealth Caribbean countries between 1948 and 1971. Update 23 April 2018  We’ve added more detail about the uncertainty surrounding the Labour Force Survey population estimates.","This is the number of Commonwealth-born people living in the UK in 2017 who arrived before 1971, and self-report as not being a UK citizen. They have the right to remain in the UK indefinitely but some have recently had problems proving their eligibility. We don’t know how many have had such problems, and some who are UK citizens could also be affected.

261,fullfact,"Based on ONS data, immigration has put English house prices up by 20% over the last 25 years.
","“Based on the ONS data, the advice put to me from the department is that in the last 25 years [1991-2016] we have seen immigration put house prices up by something like 20%.” Dominic Raab MP, 8 April 2018 Immigration has contributed 21% towards house price growth in England, according to analysis by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. But MHCLG also says the data doesn’t provide a complete answer and should be used cautiously. It found that income growth is the biggest driver of increased house prices. English house prices have risen by 320% on average over this period. Other research estimating the impact of immigration on house prices has been inconclusive. Some sources say immigration leads to significant increases in house prices, while others say that immigration leads to a fall, particularly at a local level (i.e. immigration into specific areas reduces house prices within those locales). Speaking to the Sunday Times last week, housing minister Dominic Raab said that the government’s ambition to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands would help tackle the demand side of the housing shortage, quoting analysis that immigrants had accounted for a 20% rise in house prices over the past 25 years. At the time this analysis was unpublished.  Following contact from the UK Statistics Authority, MHCLG published the analysis. The analysis uses a model developed in 2007 by the now-defunct National Housing and Planning Advice Unit (NHPAU) which says that, in England, a 1% increase in the number of households raises house prices by 2% at a national level, all other things being equal.    For its analysis MHCLG used the change in the population of England born outside of the UK as an indicator for the change in net international migration. It also assumed that the number of households increased in line with the rise in population between 1991 and 2016. Using official figures, MHCLG found the non-UK-born population in England grew by 4.8 million. This represented a roughly 10% growth in the total population of England, leading to an increase in house prices of 21%. To put that in context, the model estimated that the increase in the total population of England over this time increased prices by 32%, income increases contributed 150%, while increased housing supply pulled prices back down by 40%.     Between 1991 and 2016, the average English house price increased from £55,000 to £232,000, an increase of 320%.   When factoring in inflation, according to the Consumer Price Index, the increase amounts to 137%.     MHCLG acknowledge the model’s limits and say: “Given the complexity of the housing market, this analysis is not intended to be exhaustive in its explanatory power and throughout this release references are made to limitations.” It also says that “Use of analysis in this way should be treated cautiously and used primarily to draw stylised inferences.” For example, the calculations are based on “holding all else equal”. This means the effect of population growth, income changes and housing demand are estimated separately, without allowing for the potential that any of these factors could impact on any of the others. For example, the model doesn’t allow for the possibility that increased housing demand contributes to increased housing supply, or vice-versa. The model was also developed in 2007, and so doesn’t necessarily reflect the reality of the housing market today. For example, renting is more common now than it was in 2007.     Changes to the mortgage market during this time and falling interest rates were behind MHCLG’s decision not to estimate the effect of interest rate changes on house prices. It said the market had changed too much over the years for the figures to be reliable. As the analysis mentions, it is not intended to be exhaustive and other studies are available that analyse the relationship between immigration and house prices. Other research on the effect of immigration on house prices is inconclusive The Migration Observatory at Oxford University has said that the “evidence about the impact of migration on the cost of houses is inconclusive.” In 2008, Professor Stephen Nickell, then-head of the NHPAU, said that with projected housebuilding and immigration rates, the average house price would rise from 7 times the average income, to 10 times the average income over the period 2006 to 2026. However, if net migration was reduced to zero, the average house price would only increase to nine times the average income over the same period. In 2011, the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) (an independent body advising the government on immigration policy), commissioned research which found that the impact on house prices from immigrants with Tier 2 visas over a five-year period was likely to be “well below 1%”. However their research only considered Tier 2 visas (skilled workers), and so doesn’t estimate the impact of other visa holders (e.g. student visas, family visas). In 2014, the MAC published another study, looking at research published by Cambridge economist, Dr Filipa Sá, which found, conversely, that immigration reduced house prices slightly at a local level. The research found that for every 1% increase in a population due to immigrants arriving in the area house prices reduced by around 1.6% or 1.7%. Dr Sá found that the arrival of relatively less affluent immigrants in an area prompted natives to leave the area, and reduce house prices due to a mixture of reduced demand for houses and less wealth in the area. Another study found that immigration to a local area might decrease house prices at the lower end of the scale but had little impact on higher house prices. Nevertheless the MAC concluded that: “Migration could […] push up prices at the UK level” as UK-born residents left.     Update 23 April 2018  We updated this article to include the analysis published by MHCLG after the claim was made. It’s inappropriate for ministers to use figures that aren’t in the public domain, and figures like these should be published in full so that anyone can check where they’re from and how they’re calculated. We're grateful to the UK Statistics Authority for their help getting this analysis published.","It’s impossible to say for definite. Government analysis suggests immigration has pushed English house prices up by 20% but says it’s not meant to be a complete answer, and should be used with caution. There is no consensus across other research.

290,fullfact,"The government is spending £14 billion on primary and secondary education between now and 2022/23.
","“We're levelling up schools across the country by investing over £14 billion in primary and secondary education between now and 2022/23.” 10 Downing Street Twitter account, 31 August 2019 Last week the government announced a new package of spending for primary and secondary schools in England, which it claimed would total over £14 billion between 2019/20 and 2022/23. But Paul Johnson, Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has described this figure as “somewhere between meaningless and misleading”. The government’s announcement set out that, compared to this year, spending would be £2.6 billion higher in 2020/21, £4.8 billion higher the year after, and £7.1 billion higher in 2022/23. That all adds up to £14.5 billion, but, as we’ve said before when the government made similar claims about the NHS, adding up multiple years funding is an unhelpful way to look at the spending increase. A number of news outlets chose not to report the £14 billion figure for that reason. As we’ve said before, adding several years of spending together is simply not the normal way politicians talk about spending increases. They most commonly refer to spending on a per-year basis, or talking about the difference between the first and final year of spending. It’s not factually wrong—but it could be misleading.  Spending is planned to increase by £7.1 billion between now and 2022/23, but that also doesn’t account for inflation (the change in how much things cost over time). The £7 billion increase in spending by 2022/23 is actually £4.3 billion once inflation is accounted for, according to the IFS. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said: “Since 2009-10, school spending per pupil has fallen by 8% in real-terms in England. “The new spending plans should be near enough sufficient to reverse these cuts by 2022-23.”","The increase is £4.3 billion by 2022/23 once you account for inflation. The £14 billion figure is unhelpful as it is the figure you get if you add up all the extra money spent on education in each year to 2022/23 compared to 2019/20 and doesn’t account for inflation.

The book at the top of OnBuy’s list is inspired by the original Kama Sutra, an ancient Indian book about relationships, sexuality and marriage, which is best known for its advice on sexual positions. Of the top 10 most popular books compiled by OnBuy—which includes A Game of Thrones and Scratch & Sniff Book of Weed—the only books to appear in the top 50 lists at any point in the last three years were: OnBuy said its list was compiled after “reviewing our internal sales data from the last three years.” According to its website, the company has more than eight million customers, although it is not clear how many of those have bought books in the last three years. The number one best-selling books for each of the last three years are the same on both the Amazon and Nielsen’s metrics. In 2017 this was Jamie Oliver’s cookbook 5 Ingredients, followed by Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman in 2018 and cookbook Pinch of Nom: 100 Slimming, home style recipes by Kay Featherstone and Kay Allison in 2019.

322,fullfact,"One in seven children aged seven to nine gets less than 15 minutes a week reading time with their parents.
","“ONE in seven young children gets less than 15 minutes a week of reading time with parents, research shows.” The Sun, 4 February 2020 This week the Sun reported that one in seven young children gets less than 15 minutes a week reading time with their parents. This isn’t strictly true. The report was based off findings published by the reading charity BookTrust who commissioned Opinium Research to survey parents in January 2020. One of the questions asked to parents of children aged seven to nine was: 'How much time do you spend reading to or with your child in an average week for fun? Please do not include any reading that is set by school'. They found that 14% read with their child for less than 15 minutes a week. The problem with the press release from the BookTrust and subsequent reporting is that finding that one in seven parents doesn’t read to their child for more than 15 minutes per week doesn’t mean that one in seven children aren’t being read to for 15 minutes a week. Most children have two parents or carers in the home. We don’t know the numbers specifically for children aged seven to nine but we know that of the eight million families with dependent children, around 1.8 million are single-parent families.  And so it’s likely that parents who read to their child for less than 15 minutes per week are living in a household where there is another parent. And, as we don’t know how much that parent is reading to their child, we can’t say from this research how many children are being read to for less than 15 minutes a week, by either parent. We’ve reached out to BookTrust and will update this if they get back to us.","A survey found one in seven parents reads to their child aged seven to nine for less than 15 minutes per week. That doesn’t necessarily mean the child’s other parent isn’t reading to them as well.

","“We’re giving schools a record £14 billion, levelling up per pupil funding across the country.” Conservative Party Facebook ad, 9 September 2019 Earlier this month we wrote about a claim made by the government that spending on primary and secondary schools in England will increase by £14 billion over the next three years. We said that, while it’s not technically inaccurate, it may well be misleading because it adds up multiple years of spending increases. This isn’t how people normally talk about spending increases, and it makes the figure seem comparatively much larger than it really is. Last week the figure was used again in an ad campaign run by the Conservative Party (the ads have been deactivated following a separate article we wrote about how they seemed to alter the headline of a BBC news article). As well as repeating the £14 billion claim, the ads made two new factual claims: that this is a “record” amount, and that this is “levelling up per pupil funding across the country”. The proposed spending increase is not a record amount when you take into account inflation and rising pupil numbers (which is the most meaningful measure). Per pupil spending will increase to roughly the level it was at in 2009/10. If you don’t adjust for pupil numbers, it’s hard to say whether or not the spending increase is a “record”, because we don’t have good historical data. It’s unclear exactly what the Conservative Party meant when it said “record” and we’ve asked it for more information. The Conservatives outlined spending increases in schools in England which total £14 billion over three years. This £14 billion figure isn’t the most helpful way of looking at the numbers and is potentially misleading for a few reasons. For one, it does not account for inflation. Also, it adds together all of the increases in spending for every year between now and 2022/23 (so the increase between 2019/20 and 2020/21, as well as 2019/20 and 2021/22, and so on.) The standard practice for discussing spending changes is to talk about them on a per year basis. Once you factor these things in, spending will be £4.3 billion higher in 2022/23 than in 2019/20 in real terms. The IFS told us that’s roughly a 10% increase over the three years on schools spending. Even this figure isn’t a perfect way of looking at school spending. It doesn’t account for rising pupil numbers. As pupil numbers increase over time, the most meaningful way of looking at school spending is the amount spent “per pupil”. So the best measure to use is real-terms per-pupil spending. The IFS has said that, by this measure, schools spending is going to rise by around 7.4% per pupil by 2022/23. The IFS said “Since 2009-10, school spending per pupil has fallen by 8% in real-terms in England. The new spending plans should be near enough sufficient to reverse these cuts by 2022-23. In addition, the government is continuing to provide compensation to schools for higher pension contributions on top of this. “This package represents a large increase in spending per pupil, taking it back to about the same level it was in 2009-10. However, a 13-year period of no net growth in school spending per pupil, after inflation, still represents a significant squeeze on school budgets when considered in historical terms.” The term “record” could mean that the increase in spending is larger than schools have ever been given over a comparable time frame. There is no good consistent data to judge school spending over time, so it’s hard to say whether or not £4.3 billion is the largest ever increase over three years. However, as mentioned above, the best measure of school funding is the amount in real terms per pupil. Although the planned increase will be “large” as the IFS put it, it won’t be a record. Spending per pupil rose by 13.6% between 2004/05 and 2007/08. This was also a larger increase in absolute terms per pupil.  Alternatively, “record” could mean that following the government’s planned spending increases up to 2022/23 the total schools budget will be larger than they’ve ever been before. That’s technically correct, but not very meaningful. It isn’t unusual for government budgets to get bigger year-on-year, as they tend to go up over time as overall spending increases and, in the case of schools, pupil numbers increase. To get a better sense of how far that money can go we need to look at schools spending accounting for inflation and the spending per pupil. As we’ve touched on, analysis published by the IFS shows that the per pupil spend in 2022/23 will be almost at 2009/10 levels, though not quite as high. 2009/10 saw the highest per pupil spend in any year since 2003/04, which is the furthest back the IFS were able to analyse comparable figures.","Per pupil spending on schools in England is set to increase over the next three years to roughly the level it was at in 2009/10.

323,fullfact,"1.9 million more children are in good and outstanding schools.
","“What I wouldn’t reverse are the changes in education which mean that more than 1.9 million more children are in good and outstanding schools.” Michael Gove MP, 18 June 2019 During the BBC leadership debate, Michael Gove repeated a claim he and others in the Conservative party have made a number of times now: that there are 1.9 million more children in good and outstanding schools than there were in 2010. It’s a claim we are, unfortunately, very familiar with. As we’ve said repeatedly when this claim is made, while it is technically accurate, it’s also misleading. The UK Statistics Authority also wrote to the Department for Education last year saying that use of these figures “does not give the full picture”. And recent evidence from Ofsted gives us even more reason to be sceptical of it. The figure doesn’t account for rising pupil numbers—there were 630,000 more pupils in state-funded schools in England in 2018 compared to 2010—or changes to inspection practices in that time. A key issue is that schools rated by Ofsted as “good” or “outstanding” are less likely to be re-inspected; schools rated outstanding are also usually exempt from routine inspections. When this claim was made in 2018, analysis by the Education Policy Institute found that, for this reason, 580,000 pupils were in schools that hadn’t even been inspected since 2010. We had no way of knowing whether their rating would have stayed the same if they were re-inspected. But in recent months, Ofsted has “substantially increased” the number of exempt outstanding schools it inspects. It announced last week (shortly after our last article about the 1.9 million claim) that it had inspected 305 “outstanding” schools between September 2018 and March 2019. They found only 16% (49) kept their outstanding rating, much lower than the proportion the previous year. 30% dropped in their rating by more than one level, to either “require improvement” or “inadequate”. This doesn’t necessarily mean only 16% of all outstanding schools would still have that rating today if more were re-inspected. Ofsted makes clear that “most of these inspections are carried out because the school’s performance appears to be declining” so “it is not surprising for a large proportion to lose the top grading. The schools inspected are not typical of all outstanding schools.” Nevertheless, in response to these findings Ofsted Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman said that it should “set alarm bells ringing”. “The fact that outstanding schools are largely exempt from inspection leaves us with real gaps in our knowledge about the quality of education and safeguarding in these schools. Some of them have not been inspected for over a decade, and when our inspectors go back in, they sometimes find standards have significantly declined.” Previously, before this evidence was published, we’ve warned that the 1.9 million claim is misleading. In light of Ofsted’s findings, we’d go further: it’s simply unjustifiable for politicians to still be using this figure as evidence of improved standards.","This doesn’t acknowledge that there were 630,000 more pupils in state-funded schools in England in 2018 compared to 2010. We also don’t know how a lot of schools rated good or outstanding are doing today, as many haven’t been re-inspected for several years. Evidence from recent Ofsted inspections suggest some may now lose their high ratings.

324,fullfact,"There are now 1.9 million more children in good or outstanding schools compared with 2010.
","“1.9 million more children are in good and outstanding schools as a result of what I did.” Michael Gove MP, 9 June 2019 “Now we have 1.9 million more children in good and outstanding schools as a result of Conservative reforms.” Michael Gove MP, 10 June 2019 On the Andrew Marr Show, and then the following day at the campaign launch for his bid to become Conservative party leader, former education secretary Michael Gove repeated a claim that we’ve seen a lot of: that there are now 1.9 million more children in schools rated as “good” or “outstanding” compared to 2010 when the Coalition government came to power. This claim is technically accurate but misleading, because it ignores some important context: it doesn’t factor in the fact that pupil numbers have risen, and inspection practices have changed. Attributing the rise to government policy alone is wrong. We’ve written about this before. We’ve said the government should stop using this figure. Then we said it again, and again, and again. We’re not alone: last year, in a letter about “serious concerns” with the Department for Education’s use of statistics, the UK Statistics Authority said that this claim “does not give a full picture”. Below is what we wrote in October last year, explaining in more detail why this figure is misleading (the number has actually decreased very slightly since we wrote this, but still rounds to 1.9 million.) From 11th October 2018: “Good” and “outstanding” are the two highest ratings schools can be given by Ofsted (the schools inspector in England). Schools that don’t meet this standard are rated as “requiring improvement” or “inadequate”. There were 1.9 million more pupils in state-funded primary schools rated “good” or “outstanding” in England in August 2017, compared to August 2010. But this isn’t all down to improving standards in schools. The number of pupils in state-funded schools increased by 560,000 (7%) between 2010 and 2017—so the sheer increase in number of pupils will contribute significantly to the number of pupils in good or outstanding schools. The Education Policy Institute argues that pupils who started school after 2010 are more likely to have chosen a school if it was rated good or outstanding. It estimates that 578,000 of the 1.9 million increase is down to a combination of increasing pupil numbers, and pupil choices about which school to attend. A more meaningful comparison is to look at the percentage of pupils in good or outstanding schools. This still shows a rise: 66% of pupils were in good or outstanding schools in August 2010, compared to 88% in August 2017. But this rise is also likely to be overstated, as Ofsted has not inspected a small but significant proportion of schools since 2010—meaning we can’t be sure if they are still of the same standard. “579,000 pupils attend schools that are rated as good or outstanding but have not been inspected since at least 2010” according to the Education Policy Institute. Overall, there were around eight million pupils in state-funded schools in England in 2017. This effect is driven by a government policy where outstanding schools don’t haveto be re-inspected unless there is a significant drop in exam results, while schools rated below good or outstanding are prioritised for re-inspection. A National Audit Office report from 2018 said: “The older an inspection judgement, the greater the risk that it is no longer accurate.” It added: “exempting outstanding schools from routine re-inspection reduces the extent to which Ofsted’s inspectors see outstanding schools, and therefore the extent to which they can compare with and reference outstanding practice.” Moreover, changing inspection practices in 2012 are likely to have contributed to an increased number of schools being rated good or outstanding. In 2012, the government changed the rating “satisfactory” (the one below “good”) to “requires improvement”, and “good” became the minimum expected standard for schools. The Education Policy Institute notes that this change in ratings was followed by a step change in the number of primary schools (but not secondaries) improving at inspection in the following year (rising from 48% to 57%). It theorises that inspectors were less likely to give the new “requires improvement” rating, as it was more punitive for schools. It accepts that the point above is not a “full analysis of the issue”. However, it underlines the level of uncertainty around what is driving the increasing number of pupils in good or outstanding schools.","This doesn’t acknowledge that there were 560,000 more pupils in state-funded schools in England in 2017 compared to 2010, and changes to inspection practices. 580,000 pupils are in schools that haven’t been inspected since 2010.

325,fullfact,"85% of schools are good and outstanding schools, vs 68% in 2010.
","“Our schools have made great progress: 85% of schools are good and outstanding schools, vs 68% in 2010” Damian Hinds MP, 29 April 2019 This statement from the Secretary of State for Education is technically accurate for England, but misleading without a lot more context. The government is resurfacing a variant of a statistic which has been roundly criticised in the past (and still suffers from many of the same problems). Last October, we called on the government to stop making a similar claim about there being 1.9 million more children in good or outstanding schools since 2010, and the figure was also criticised by the Chair of the UK Statistics Authority for not giving “a full picture.” We pointed out at the time that the Department for Education’s claim didn’t acknowledge that a significant chunk of the increase will simply be down to more children being in schools in the first place. The government has since tweaked the claim, to talk about the percentage of schools being good or outstanding, rather than the number of children in them. This does address the pupil numbers issue, but other problems remain. Most crucially, inspection practices mean we can’t properly compare the levels today with those in 2010. The issue is that schools rated below good or outstanding are prioritised for re-inspection (so their ratings might go up). But if a school is already rated highly, it is less likely to be inspected again (so its rating won’t go down). As of 2017, almost 580,000 pupils were in schools that were rated good or outstanding, but which hadn’t been inspected since at least 2010—so we don’t really know if they are actually still good or outstanding nearly a decade down the line. In other words, the system is set up in such a way that you would expect the number of schools with a good or outstanding rating to go up over time, even if that might not necessarily reflect the real situation. The ratings system for schools also changed in 2012, which could have further affected the numbers. These points should not come as a surprise to the Secretary of State for Education, and the government should not be using this statistic.","This refers to England, and doesn’t acknowledge changes to inspection practices. A significant chunk of pupils are in schools that haven’t been inspected since 2010.

326,fullfact,"1.9 million more children are now in good and outstanding schools, compared with 2010.
","“1.9 million more children are now in good and outstanding schools, compared with 2010, and part of that is the result of the reforms we have made to education”. Theresa May, 10 October 2018 On Monday this week, the chair of the UK Statistics Authority wrote to the Department for Education to express concern about a number of statistics it has presented. One of these was the claim that there are 1.9 million more children in good or outstanding schools since 2010. The Statistics Authority said: “While accurate as far as it goes, this figure does not give a full picture.” This is because much of the increase could be down to rising pupil numbers—there were 560,000 more pupils in state-funded schools in England in 2017 compared to 2010—and changes to inspection practices. 579,000 pupils attend schools that are rated as good or outstanding but have not been inspected since at least 2010, and inspection practices mean schools rated below “good” are prioritised for inspection. On Wednesday, the claim was repeated by the Prime Minister at Prime Minister’s Questions—albeit with something of a caveat about the government only being responsible for “part” of that increase. However, this caveat does not fully spell out how much uncertainty there is around this number. It would be more helpful to public debate if the government made this uncertainty clear, or stopped using this statistic completely. “Good” and “outstanding” are the two highest ratings schools can be given by Ofsted (the schools inspector in England). Schools that don’t meet this standard are rated as “requiring improvement” or “inadequate”.

327,fullfact,"1,620 schools, most rated outstanding, haven’t been inspected for six years or more. 290 haven’t been inspected for more than a decade.
","“A National Audit Office report found 1,620 schools, mostly outstanding, had not been inspected for six years or more, and 290 for a decade or more.” BBC News, 24 May 2018 “Last year, 91% of school places created were in good or outstanding schools.” Conservative Party, 29 May 2018 It’s correct that 1,620 schools had not been inspected by Ofsted for at least six years as of August 2017. That’s according to Ofsted data analysed by the National Audit Office (NAO). 97% of those schools (1,570) were rated outstanding at their last inspection, while the remaining 3% (50 schools) were rated good. 296 of these schools had not been inspected for between 10 and 11 years. All of these were rated outstanding at their last inspection. 91% of the 92,500 new school places in England primary and secondary state schools between 2015/16 and 2016/17 were in those that had a good or outstanding rating from Ofsted. There are around 21,500 state-funded schools in England, teaching around eight million pupils, that Ofsted inspects. It can give four types of rating for the overall effectiveness of a school: outstanding, good, requires improvement or inadequate. Ofsted has to inspect schools every five years, unless the school was last graded as outstanding. Outstanding schools are exempt from routine re-inspection, but may be inspected sooner if concerns are raised or there’s a significant change. Outstanding special schools, pupil referral units (which provide full-time education for permanently excluded children or those who have missed school because of illness) and state-funded nursery schools are not exempt, and will usually have short inspections every four years. The same goes for schools rated good.  Schools rated good are also subject to shorter one-day inspections every four years, and schools that require improvement usually have a full re-inspection within two and a half years. Schools that convert to academies are considered to be new schools. The new academy will usually be inspected by Ofsted within three years of reopening. That said, the NAO found that between 2012/13 and 2016/17 312 schools that had converted to academies went at least five years before being inspected. The NAO also found that of the 215 schools last rated good had not been inspected for five or more years, most of these were converted academies. 186 of those had converted to academies after their last inspection and had not been inspected since. Ofsted’s director of corporate strategy reportedly agreed with the statement that some outstanding schools weren’t “really outstanding”. The NAO’s report said: “The older an inspection judgement, the greater the risk that it is no longer accurate.” They added: “exempting outstanding schools from routine re-inspection reduces the extent to which Ofsted’s inspectors see outstanding schools, and therefore the extent to which they can compare with and reference outstanding practice.” As of August 2017, 20% of schools, including primary, secondary, special schools and pupil referral units, had been rated outstanding for overall effectiveness by Ofsted at their last inspection. 65% had been rated good, 9% required improvement, 2% were inadequate and 4% hadn’t yet been inspected. This does not include education providers that are solely nurseries or sixth forms.  Between 2015/16 and 2016/17, around 92,500 new school places were created in England’s primary and secondary state schools. 84,400 (91%) of these places were at schools rated outstanding or good at their last Ofsted inspection as of August 2017.  The data was collected by local authorities by measuring school capacities between May 2016 and May 2017. Not all school places were included, for example free schools (schools funded by central government, not run by the local authority) and sponsored academies that hadn’t yet had an Ofsted inspection. Increases of fewer than 15 places in a school weren’t counted as new places.","Correct. 1,620 state schools in England, most of which were rated outstanding in their last inspection, have not been inspected for six years or more.

In other words they were more successful per applicant. But only about 700 people applied from the North East, and over 9,000 applied from London.” Dominic Lawson, 24 May 2018 This is correct. Figures published by Oxford University show that between 2015 and 2017 around 9,200 undergraduate applications were made to Oxford by students from Greater London. Of these around 2,200 offers were made (24% of the total number of applications) and 1,900 students took up their place (21% of the total). Applications from Greater London made up just over 25% of all applications from the UK in those three years. Meanwhile around 13% of the total UK population lives in Greater London—based on 2011 census figures. This proportion is similar looking at the numbers of 18 and 19 year olds in the UK. Around 17% of all UK applicants to higher education institutions in the UK were from London in 2018. Between 2015 and 2017 there were around 700 applications to Oxford from students in the North East of England. Of these around 200 offers were made (28% of the total applications from there) and just under 200 were admitted (25%).  Looking at the difference between the proportion of applicants from each region in the UK and the total share of the UK population that region made up, students from Greater London were most overrepresented among applications and admissions to Oxford, while students from Scotland were most underrepresented.  This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Correct, looking at applications from, and offers to, UK-domiciled potential undergraduates between 2015 and 2017.

BME students make up 17.9% of all British Oxford undergraduates. That’s pretty close to the percentage of BME people among 17-24-year-olds in England and Wales – 18.3%.
","“You are twice as likely to get into @UniofOxford as a white applicant (24%) than a black applicant (12%). Why? 1/4 Oxford colleges did not admit a single black student in a whole year group at least once between 2015-17. 8 colleges less than 1% black. Why?” David Lammy MP, 23 May 2018 “BME students make up 17.9% of all British Oxford undergraduates. That's pretty close to the percentage of BME people among 17-24-year-olds in England and Wales – 18.3%.” Toby Young, 23 May 2018 Both David Lammy and Toby Young are both broadly correct in their claims, yet they are making contrasting points about how accessible the University of Oxford is for black and minority ethnic students. The exact figures vary depending on which year you look at, whether you’re talking about the overall student population or applicants’ relative chances of being accepted, and also which groups in particular you are talking about. 2017 was the first year (in recent times at least) when Oxford’s UK undergraduate intake had a similar level of black and minority ethnic students to the general population of England and Wales aged 17-24, but black students are still underrepresented. Black students who apply to Oxford are less likely to be accepted than white students, and in some colleges make up less than 1% of all students from the UK. All figures in this article refer to applicants for undergraduate courses living in the UK. 16% of black students living in the UK who applied to the University of Oxford in 2017 were offered a place, compared to 26% of white students. Over the last three years, the average is 17% for black students and 27% for white students. Not all of these students will necessarily take up their place though. 12% of black students living in the UK who applied to Oxford were admitted for the year 2017/18. 23% of UK-domiciled white applicants were. Over the last three years, the average is 12% for black students and 24% for white students. Around 6% of applicants to Oxford living in the UK didn’t declare their ethnicity from 2013 to 2017, so some students will not be included in the figures. The University of Oxford says that that “students from BME backgrounds are more likely to apply for the most competitive courses than White students”. 41% of black students from the UK who applied to Oxford between 2015 and 2017 applied for medicine or law, which Oxford describes as “highly competitive”. In comparison around 12% of white students applied for these courses. For these courses, white students are significantly more likely to be made an offer or admitted than black students. 11% of black law applicants from 2015to 2017 received an offer, and 6% were admitted. 23% of white applicants received an offer, and 20% were admitted. For medicine, 9% of black students received an offer and 8% were admitted, compared to 22% and 20% respectively for white students. Eight of the 29 colleges at Oxford admitted two or fewer black students between 2015 and 2017 (less than 1% of all UK students admitted to the college). This means that in at least one year those colleges can’t have admitted any black students. We don’t know what happened in each of the individual years between 2015 and 2017, so it’s possible there were more colleges who didn’t admit any black students in any given year. No college admitted more than seven black students across those three years—again that’s looking at students living in the UK. Across the university black students made up 1.9% of all UK students admitted in 2017. Black and minority ethnic students made up around 18% of Oxford’s 2017 UK intake. That’s roughly the same as the proportion of 17-24 year-olds in England and Wales who are black and minority ethnic, based on figures from the 2011 census. In 2016, 26% of UK students starting an undergraduate degree at all UK universities were black or minority ethnic, compared to 16% at Oxford. Applicants to Oxford normally need to get at least three As to be offered a place. Looking at UK students who got three As (or equivalent) at A-level, 20% of students were black or minority ethnic in 2015, compared to 14% of Oxford’s UK intake that year. Among black and minority ethnic students, certain groups are more represented than others. 1.9% of Oxford’s UK undergraduates starting in 2017 were black, and 1.7% were Bangladeshi or Pakistani. 6.5% were Asian (not including those who identified as Bangladeshi or Pakistani which Oxford provides separate figures for), and 6.6% had mixed heritage. Among the population of England and Wales now aged 17 to 24, around 4% identify as Bangladeshi/Pakistani, 4.5% identify as Asian, 4% identify as Black. This is based on approximations using the 2011 census.  Update 4 June 2018  We updated this piece to add more information on the proportions of black and minority ethnic students at Oxford.","
 
Correct, for undergraduate students from the UK who took up their place in 2017, and looking at those in the 2011 census who would be between 17 and 24 today.

The exact figures vary depending on which year you look at, whether you’re talking about the overall student population or applicants’ relative chances of being accepted, and also which groups in particular you are talking about. 2017 was the first year (in recent times at least) when Oxford’s UK undergraduate intake had a similar level of black and minority ethnic students to the general population of England and Wales aged 17-24, but black students are still underrepresented. Black students who apply to Oxford are less likely to be accepted than white students, and in some colleges make up less than 1% of all students from the UK. All figures in this article refer to applicants for undergraduate courses living in the UK. 16% of black students living in the UK who applied to the University of Oxford in 2017 were offered a place, compared to 26% of white students. Over the last three years, the average is 17% for black students and 27% for white students. Not all of these students will necessarily take up their place though. 12% of black students living in the UK who applied to Oxford were admitted for the year 2017/18. 23% of UK-domiciled white applicants were. Over the last three years, the average is 12% for black students and 24% for white students. Around 6% of applicants to Oxford living in the UK didn’t declare their ethnicity from 2013 to 2017, so some students will not be included in the figures. The University of Oxford says that that “students from BME backgrounds are more likely to apply for the most competitive courses than White students”. 41% of black students from the UK who applied to Oxford between 2015 and 2017 applied for medicine or law, which Oxford describes as “highly competitive”. In comparison around 12% of white students applied for these courses. For these courses, white students are significantly more likely to be made an offer or admitted than black students. 11% of black law applicants from 2015to 2017 received an offer, and 6% were admitted. 23% of white applicants received an offer, and 20% were admitted. For medicine, 9% of black students received an offer and 8% were admitted, compared to 22% and 20% respectively for white students. Eight of the 29 colleges at Oxford admitted two or fewer black students between 2015 and 2017 (less than 1% of all UK students admitted to the college). This means that in at least one year those colleges can’t have admitted any black students. We don’t know what happened in each of the individual years between 2015 and 2017, so it’s possible there were more colleges who didn’t admit any black students in any given year. No college admitted more than seven black students across those three years—again that’s looking at students living in the UK. Across the university black students made up 1.9% of all UK students admitted in 2017. Black and minority ethnic students made up around 18% of Oxford’s 2017 UK intake. That’s roughly the same as the proportion of 17-24 year-olds in England and Wales who are black and minority ethnic, based on figures from the 2011 census. In 2016, 26% of UK students starting an undergraduate degree at all UK universities were black or minority ethnic, compared to 16% at Oxford. Applicants to Oxford normally need to get at least three As to be offered a place. Looking at UK students who got three As (or equivalent) at A-level, 20% of students were black or minority ethnic in 2015, compared to 14% of Oxford’s UK intake that year. Among black and minority ethnic students, certain groups are more represented than others. 1.9% of Oxford’s UK undergraduates starting in 2017 were black, and 1.7% were Bangladeshi or Pakistani. 6.5% were Asian (not including those who identified as Bangladeshi or Pakistani which Oxford provides separate figures for), and 6.6% had mixed heritage. Among the population of England and Wales now aged 17 to 24, around 4% identify as Bangladeshi/Pakistani, 4.5% identify as Asian, 4% identify as Black. This is based on approximations using the 2011 census.  Update 4 June 2018  We updated this piece to add more information on the proportions of black and minority ethnic students at Oxford.","
 
Correct, for undergraduate students from the UK who took up their place between 2015 and 2017.

Higher education in this country is blindingly middle class.
","“The fact is, as anybody who works in higher education, as I do, will tell you. Higher education in this country is blindingly white and it is blindingly middle-class.” Sarah Churchwell, 24 May 2018 In the UK in 2016/17, 74% of UK-domiciled students in their first year of undergraduate study were white, but at the same time white pupils are the least likely of any ethnic group in England to enter higher education. A number of measures of social background show that the more disadvantaged your background, the less likely you are to go into higher education. On most of these measures, the gap in access has been falling over time, but remains much higher at the most selective universities. In the UK in 2016/17, 74% of UK-domiciled students in their first year of an undergraduate degree reported they were white, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). That compares to 78% in 2012/13. Among 18 year-olds in England, white pupils are the least likely ethnic group to begin higher education in the UK, according to UCAS. 29% of white 18 year-olds began higher education in 2017. There are a number of different ways of looking at how many students are entering higher education based on their background and level of disadvantage. One way to measure this is based on where a pupil lives, and assessing the levels of access to higher education for pupils from that area in the past. 18 year-olds from the most advantaged fifth of areas are more than twice as likely to get a place in higher education as those from the least advantaged fifth. This gap has fallen over time—they were three times more likely to in 2010, and four times in 2006. You can also measure disadvantage using a wider range of characteristics, including sex, ethnicity, where pupils live, and whether they were privately educated. It shows a similar trend. The most advantaged fifth of students were four times more likely to access higher education in 2017 than the most disadvantaged fifth. This gap has been narrowing over time, but it has stopped doing so in the last two years. Based on these measures, the gap between the most and least advantaged students is wider at the most selective universities compared to other higher education institutions. We’ve written more about this here. Pupils receiving free school meals at the age of 15 were half as likely to access higher education in 2017 as those who didn’t receive them. The gap had been falling over time, although it has stopped in the last two years. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","

Around 40% of students at universities such as Oxford went to private school. 7% of the population go to private school.
","“when you look at the top of almost all the major professions and look at universities like Oxford, that are taking in more kids from state school, but I think it’s still around 40% from private school and only 7% of the population go to private school, I think social class remains as big an issue in the UK as it’s ever been.” Richard Bacon, 7 December 2017 “There are more people from deprived backgrounds going into universities than ever before.” Bernard Jenkin MP, 7 December 2017 It’s correct that private school pupils are still disproportionately represented in top professions and among University of Oxford undergraduates. It’s also the case that there are more 18 year olds from disadvantaged areas going to university than ever before in England, Wales and Scotland, according to UCAS figures. In Northern Ireland it is the second highest on record. On this measure, the gap between disadvantaged pupils and advantaged pupils across the UK has narrowed in the last ten years, although it is unchanged in the last year. Around 44% of young, undergraduate full-time students attending the University of Oxford in 2015/16 went to an independent school, according to the latest data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency. Looking at the third most selective universities in England, around 23% of state school pupils who took A levels or equivalent qualifications went to these in 2014/15, compared to 65% of pupils at independent schools. This gap is the largest it has been since 2008/09 (as far back as these figures go). The gap is smaller looking just at pupils who took A levels. Across the whole of England 7% of students were attending an independent school in January 2017. That’s the same proportion as it’s been since at least 2003. An analysis of ‘leading people’ in the UK by the social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust found that private school pupils were disproportionately represented at the top of many of the UK’s professions. It found that in 2015 around three fifths of top doctors went to private school, almost three quarters of top military officers and top judges and around a third of UK educated FTSE 100 CEOs. Around half of the senior civil service and top journalists were privately educated. We’ve looked more at these figures here. Looking at the latest intake of MPs following the June 2017 election the Sutton Trust also found that 29% were privately educated. In 2016 the proportion of 18 year-olds living in the most disadvantaged areas going to university increased for all countries in the UK. It increased to the highest on record in England (almost 20%), Wales (18%) and Scotland (11%). In Northern Ireland it was at 16%, the second highest recorded level. Compared to 2006, the gap between the proportions of disadvantaged and advantaged students going to university has narrowed across all four countries. In the past year, the gap has stayed broadly the same. Scotland’s figures shouldn’t be directly compared to those from the rest of the UK because there is a substantial chunk of higher education provision in Scotland not included in these figures. Figures for 2017 will be published next week. Disadvantage here is measured according to the rate of participation in higher education by young people in each area of the country, so the most disadvantaged areas are those with the lowest rates of participation by young people. There are a number of other ways to measure disadvantage and we’ve looked into them in more detail here. Looking at pupils in England receiving free school meals, an increasing proportion are going to university by age 19, according to figures from the Department for Education. An estimated 24% of English pupils receiving free school meals had gone to university by the time they were 19 in 2014/15—the highest on record. The gap between students not receiving free school meals and those who do has remained at around 17-18 percentage points over the last eight years, based on these figures.

An estimated 24% of English pupils receiving free school meals had gone to university by the time they were 19 in 2014/15—the highest on record. The gap between students not receiving free school meals and those who do has remained at around 17-18 percentage points over the last eight years, based on these figures. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Correct. In 2016 the proportion of 18 year-olds living in the most disadvantaged areas going to university was the highest on record for England, Scotland and Wales. It’s the second highest level it has ever been in Northern Ireland.

","“A quarter of primary school leavers are unable to read or write properly,” Jeremy Hunt, 16 June 2019 “Too many children leave school unable to read and write properly… you have nearly 25% of primary school leavers unable to read,” Jeremy Hunt, 18 June 2019 During his campaign for leadership of the Conservative party, Jeremy Hunt has repeated a claim about the number of children leaving primary school being unable to read or write properly. ”Properly” is the key word in this claim as this statistic isn’t actually about the proportion of primary school leavers who are completely illiterate. There are different ways of measuring reading and writing aptitude. In 2018, 75% of year 6 students (10 and 11 year-olds) in England reached the expected standard in their SATs reading test and 78% in grammar, punctuation and spelling. The Department for Education also publishes statistics on how many year 6 students reach the expected standard according to teacher assessments, as opposed to SATs scores. Teachers assessed 78% of students to have reached at least the expected writing standard and 80% to have reached the expected reading standard.  SATs scores and teacher assessments are not the only way to measure literacy.  For example, England takes part in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) which measures reading aptitude among year 5  (9 to 10 year-olds) students. The latest data, from 2016, shows that 86% of these students reached at least the intermediate benchmark for reading.","25% of 10 and 11 year-old students in England did not reach the expected level of reading in their SATs and 22% when tested on grammar, punctuation and spelling.

333,fullfact,"Analysis by the Children’s Society has found that more than 1 million children living in poverty would miss out on a free school meal because of the cliff edge.
","“Analysis by the Children’s Society has found that more than 1 million children living in poverty would miss out on a free school meal because of the cliff edge.” Sharon Hodgson MP, 6 February 2018 The Children’s Society has estimated that more than one million children living in relative poverty in England will not get a free school meal under new rules.  This is a rough estimate which makes a number of assumptions based on available data. It is not a calculation of how many children will miss out compared to the old benefit-linked system. The government is introducing a new earnings threshold—the “cliff edge” referred to here—children in families earning under this amount are eligible for free school meals. This replaces previous eligibility rules which were tied to whether families received certain benefits, and replaces temporary measures which extended eligibility to all households receiving Universal Credit during the roll-out. The government has said that by 2022 an additional 50,000 children will claim free school meals under the new system compared to if the old benefits-linked system continued. This excludes children whose eligibility is protected under the roll-out period. It hasn’t published the full methodology used to reach this figure so it’s not possible to verify it. The Children’s Society’s figures also seek to measure the number of children who end up receiving free school meals, instead of the number who are eligible. So these estimates don’t just reflect the eligibility criteria, but also the lower proportions of children who end up claiming and receiving free school meals.   The Children’s Society has also made a separate claim that one million children will lose out on free school meals under the new rules compared to if all children in households claiming Universal Credit received free meals once it’s fully rolled out. We haven’t looked at this claim in this piece. Universal Credit is a new benefit that replaces a range of existing benefits. Roll-out of Universal Credit started in 2013, and is expected to be completed by 2022. Before the introduction of Universal Credit, children could receive free school meals if their family received any of a list of benefits, including income support, jobseeker’s allowance, employment and support allowance, and child tax credit. Since 2013, children in all families moving to Universal Credit have been eligible for free school meals. The government introduced this as a temporary measure, which expanded eligibility, and is now introducing a new income threshold to replace this. From April, English school children in Year Three or above and in households receiving Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals if their family earns below £7,400 per year, before benefits are taken into account. All infant school children will continue to receive free school meals in England. Children who were eligible for free school meals before April will continue to receive them while Universal Credit is being rolled out, even if their family’s income rises above the new threshold. Those who become eligible under the new rules after April will also be protected against losing eligibility if their income rises during the roll-out.  And after the roll-out is complete, children who received free school meals during the roll-out will continue to receive them until they move to a new stage of school, such as from primary into secondary school. The government is introducing these changes because it says it wants to “target support to those families and children most in need”, rather than having wider eligibility criteria. The government has estimated that after the rollout half of UK children will be in households that receive Universal Credit—which would make roughly the same number eligible for free school meals if they made the temporary eligibility to all Universal Credit claimants permanent. Under the old system, 14% of school children were eligible for and receiving free school meals in January 2017.   The Children’s Society says that under the income threshold “a million children in poverty will miss out on a free school meal”. As the Children’s Society also says, this is not new. In January 2017, 1.1 million children in English primary and secondary schools were eligible for and claiming free school meals, while there were between 2.2 million and 4.1 million children living in poverty in 2016/17, depending on the measure used. However, the Children’s Society are saying that if eligibility continued for all children in households claiming Universal Credit, then all children living in poverty would be eligible. That said, eligibility for Universal Credit is not directly based on whether a family is living in poverty, and takes into account a number of factors. The Children’s Society has pulled together a combination of sources to make its estimate. These estimates are limited by the available data. Broadly, its claim is based on combining an estimate of the number of children eligible for free school meals under the old system, with the government’s estimate that 50,000 more children will receive meals by 2022 under the new system. It does this to estimate how many will be eligible under the new rules. It then compares this to the number of children in relative poverty, after housing costs, in 2015/16. So it combines figures for recent years with forecasts for the future. There are a number of other factors affecting these estimates. One issue is that the official figures do not distinguish between infants claiming free school meals as part of the Universal Free School Meals policy (which will not be changing), and older primary school children claiming free school meals. This means that to get estimates for the number of children in Year Three and above—those who will be affected by the eligibility change—the Children’s Society has had to look at what proportion of children are in Year Three and above and apply this to some of the figures. Doing this won’t account for differences in take-up rates of free school meals between infants and older children. A similar issue affects its calculations of the number of children in poverty—it has applied the proportion of children living in relative poverty to its estimate of the number of children in Year Three and above, to estimate how many of them are living in poverty. This won’t account for any differences in poverty levels by children’s ages. Lastly, not all eligible parents register for free school meals. According to research collated by the Children’s Food Trust charity in 2013, reasons for this include being unaware of their eligibility, having difficulty understanding the application process; stigma; objections to the food itself; and other reasons such as wanting to sit with friends having packed lunches. The Children’s Society has taken account of this by using official figures for the numbers of children who received free school meals on the day of the school census when these figures are collected. That means these figures won’t take account of children who may receive free school meals some or most of the time but who didn’t receive them on this day. The government’s calculations use an estimate of the number of eligible children who end up claiming free school meals, based on research it undertook in 2013. So unlike the Children’s Society’s estimates, this doesn’t take account of children who claim but don’t end up taking the meals. The government estimates that the changes to the system will result in around 50,000 more pupils claiming free school meals by 2022, compared to the number that would have been eligible by that time under the old benefits system. It also estimated in its earlier consultation on the changes that around 90% of pupils who were eligible for free school meals under the old system will still be eligible under the new system—so around 10% would lose eligibility.  It told us this excludes the transitional protections being put in place. It hasn’t published the full methodology used to reach these figures or the numbers behind them so it’s not possible to verify them. It has published some details regarding the 50,000 figure. It said it has used two Department for Work and Pensions’ models to estimate the number of people that will move onto Universal Credit by 2022, whether their earnings will be above or below £7,400, and whether they would be eligible for free school meals if they were on the old benefits system. It then estimates: The government says that the difference between these two numbers is 50,000. Children who are protected during the roll-out are excluded from the government’s analysis.  It also adjusts the data to account for the fact that not all eligible families claim—using an estimate from 2013 that around 11% of pupils who are eligible don’t claim. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has also looked at how many more children will be eligible under the new system. Similar to the government, it found that around 50,000 more children across the UK would be eligible. That includes 160,000 children who would become ineligible compared to the old system and 210,000 who would become eligible having not been before. But it says that 70,000 more may end up receiving the meals. This is because it estimates that take up of free school meals will increase under Universal Credit. Here’s the full break-down of how it calculated the figures: 1 - It estimates 5.8 million children are in Year Three and above In total there were about 5.7 million children in Year Three and above, including secondary schools and special schools in 2017. Of those in primary school, 52% were in Year Three and above. There is a separate data set of pupils eligible for free school meals, which confusingly includes a slightly larger number of pupils because it counts additional nurseries not included in the other data set. This doesn’t provide a breakdown by year group so the Children’s Society has applied the 52% from the previous dataset to these figures, estimating that there are about 5.8 million children in Year 3 and above. 2 - It estimates about 17% of children are eligible for free school meals based on the old system linked to specific benefits Then it estimated the number of children eligible for free school meals under the old benefits-linked system. There is only official data for how many children end up claiming free school meals, so it had to use tax credit data to work out how many are eligible. There were 2.3 million children in families receiving the maximum child tax credit or child allowances as part of other benefits in 2015/16, according to official data. Other benefits also give families eligibility to free school meals, but the Children’s Society says these two are a good general indication. It then compares this to the total number of children in the UK in 2015/16, to find that about 17% of children are entitled to free school meals. 3 - It estimates about 985,000 children in Year Three and above are eligible for free school meals under the old criteria Applying the proportion from (2) to the school population in (1), it estimates 985,000 children in England in Year Three and above are eligible for free school meals. 4 - It estimates that about one million children in Year Three and above would be entitled under the new proposals It then then adds 60,000 to the estimate from (3). This is the 50,000 extra children the government estimates will get a meal under the new rules, with an extra 10,000 added to roughly account for the difference between the number of children who are eligible for a free school meal and the number who actually take a meal. It adds this to make an estimate of how many children will be eligible under the new rules. Adding these two suggests that 1,045,000 children in Year Three and above are entitled to free school meals.  5 - It estimates that about 680,000 children would be likely to claim free school meals About 900,000 children actually took a free school meal on the day of the school census in January 2017. The Children’s Society estimates this includes about 640,000 children in Year Three and above—based on the numbers of pupils in these school years from (1). It says this implies that 65% of entitled children took a free school meal, taken as a proportion of the 985,000 children it estimates are entitled to free school meals under the old benefits-linked system. Using this proportion, and applying it to the total in (4) the Children’s Society estimates that 680,000 children would be likely to take a meal.  6 - It estimates that roughly 1.7 million children in year three and above are in relative poverty An estimated 29% of children in England were living in relative poverty in 2015/16, after housing costs are taken into account—according to official statistics. That counts children aged 0-16, and up to 19 years old if they’re still classed as dependent on their parents. The Children’s Society says that applying this to the number of school children in Year Three and above (1), suggests roughly 1.7 million are living in relative poverty. So that’s a million more than the 680,000 children it estimates would end up receiving free school meals.   Update 12 June 2018  We updated this article with new analysis published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.","This comes from a rough estimate of how many children could receive free school meals under the new income threshold, compared to the number of children living in poverty. It is not a calculation of how many will miss out compared to the old benefit-linked system.

334,fullfact,"Some grammar schools get less than £4,500 per pupil. Other state schools can receive as much as £8,000.
","“Many of the 163 grammars are facing a crisis under May, even though she promised to champion them. Some get less than £4,500 per pupil, among the lowest funding in the UK. Other state schools can receive as much as £8,000.”    The Sunday Times, 8 July 2018 It’s correct that around half of grammar schools in England received less than £4,500 per pupil in 2016/17. No grammar school received more than £5,500 per pupil. Around 70 (or 5%) of the 1,500 non-grammar state schools taking students aged 11-18 received under £4,500 per pupil. A small number (21) received more than £8,000 per pupil. On average, grammar schools in England received around £4,500 per pupil, while other state schools received £5,200. It’s been reported that the new formula used to fund schools will boost grammar school budgets relatively more than other schools in coming years. Grammar schools are selective state secondary schools found in England and Northern Ireland. There are 163 grammar schools in England, which the claim refers to, so we’ll focus on the schools there. Schools get different kinds of funding. The vast majority of school funding comes from “basic entitlements”, with the rest coming from other grants such as those based on how deprived pupils at the school are. Grammar schools and other state schools received similar levels of basic entitlement. In 2016/17 English grammar schools received an average of £4,100 a student, and other English state schools received £4,300. Grammar schools however receive much less in other grants than other comparable state schools. For example, they receive about £250 per student less in deprivation funding, reflecting the fact that pupils in grammar schools are from relatively less disadvantaged backgrounds than pupils at other state schools They also receive around £250 less in other funding sources. For example, no grammar school received money for funding private finance initiatives (PFI) costs while around 100 other state schools did—as much as £2,100 per pupil in one school. There is also a difference in the range of funding the different school types receive. While all grammars receive broadly similar funding per pupil (ranging from £4,100 to £5,400), non-grammar state schools can receive very different levels of funding per pupil (from £4,100 to £9,500). We’ve excluded the “education services grant” from our calculations. This is given to academies to “cover the cost of the services that local authorities provide centrally to maintained schools but that academies must secure independently”. Including the grant for academies only would skew the overall data when trying to compare grammar schools with other schools. We’ve also only included non-grammar state schools that take pupils of the same age range as grammar schools (11-18). This also excludes “all through” schools who offer primary and secondary education.  We've also excluded special schools. Finally we’ve used 2016/17 funding data rather than 2017/18 funding data. That’s because information about the types of schools (for example whether a school is a grammar or another type of state school) is only available from 2016/17. School funding is allocated primarily based on each local council’s funding formula which means there are big differences in school funding between regions. You can view an interactive map here. Once that is taken into account, grammar schools generally receive less funding than other state schools in the same area. Of the 36 councils with grammar schools, only two put more money into pupils in grammar schools—£10 more per pupil in Essex and £32 more per pupil in Kirklees. The largest gap was in Slough where grammar schools received around £1,300 less per pupil on average than the other state schools in the area.   You can find an interactive map of the data here. The reason why schools receive such different amounts is partly down to the individual characteristics of each school, but also down to how funding has been managed historically. State-funded schools fall into two main groups: academies, where funding and oversight is directly from the Department for Education, and maintained schools, where funding and oversight is through councils, Up until recently, the government has decided how much of the budget to hand over to each council, largely based on how much each council has received per pupil in previous years. In 2016/17, the year which the data above refers to, this was still the case. Each council then uses a local funding formula to share this money out to local schools. They take into account several factors such as pupil numbers, deprivation, and prior attainment. Although outside of the control of councils, the money used to fund academies and free schools is still calculated using the local funding formulas. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, the Education Policy Institute (EPI) think tank, the government, and others have all said the old funding system is flawed and awards money inconsistently. Part of this is intentional, the IFS has said, because of deliberate choices by the government to target funding towards disadvantaged schools and areas with higher costs. But some variation has been more unintentional. You can read more about how the school funding system works here.   Correction 3 August 2018  We've updated the graphs and article to clarify that special schools are excluded from the calculations.","Correct. In 2016/17 English grammars received on average £4,500 per pupil while other state schools received £5,200.

In the last eight years, university tuition fees have trebled.
","“If I look at the journey of the young person in my constituency, from a child to becoming an adult—children's centres had to close due to the cuts the government made over the last eight years. Then you went to school, your building schools for the future project, renewing our school buildings, stopped. You then got to further education, education maintenance allowance was taken away from you and then if you made it to university, your tuition fees were trebled. That isn’t investing in young people, that is taking away from young people.” Chuka Umunna MP, 10 May 2018 Chuka Umunna correctly identified a number of Coalition and Conservative government policies relating to young people and education. In some cases, where the government stopped a policy, they also replaced it with a new one. We take a look at each of the policies identified, and their impact, in further detail. This is not meant to be a complete assessment of the Coalition and Conservative record on youth and education. Rather, it looks specifically at the areas picked out by Mr Umunna. 508 children's centres closed in England between 2010 and August 2017, according to the government. There were around 3,600 in 2010, compared to just over 3,100 late last year. You can’t perfectly compare the number of children’s centres in 2010 and 2017 though, due to changes in how the data is recorded. There are two types of centre included in these figures. Sure Start centres provide childcare, family support and health advice to local families, and have to meet a legal definition, whereas other “children’s centres” provide some of these services, but don’t meet the legal definition. In 2010, there were around 3,630 Sure Start centres. By late 2017, the number of Sure Start centres had fallen by around 1,200. The National Audit Office found that spending by councils in England on Sure Start fell by 50% in real terms from 2010/11 to 2016/17. The Coalition government did end Labour’s “Building schools for the future programme” (BSF) in 2010, although it replaced it with its own scheme: “Priority School Building Programme” (PSBP). Announced in 2003, Labour’s BSF aimed “to rebuild, refurbish and provide new Information Technology for all 3,500 secondary schools in England by 2020”. In 2009 this was estimated to cost £52 to £55 billion. By 2009, the National Audit Office reported that the speed of delivery would need to increase to complete the programme on time. “Fifty-four schools are due to open in 2009 and 121 in the following year. To start all secondary schools by 2020, the number of schools in procurement and construction at any one time will need to double over the next three years.” In July 2010, the Coalition government announced the project would be frozen “In order to ensure that we do not waste any more money on a dysfunctional process”. The Coalition government then announced its own programme (PSBP) in 2011. It aimed to rebuild and refurbish 537 “school buildings in the worst condition across the country” by 2021, and was expected to cost £4.4 billion in 2016. In 2017, the National Audit Office found that on average schools built under the new programme “are one-third cheaper per square metre than schools built under” the previous one. There were some reported concerns “about what the Department has done to reduce costs (for example, decreasing the size of communal spaces)”. Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) was ended in England by the Coalition government at the end of the year 2010/11, and replaced by a new “16 to 19 bursaries” scheme. EMA is still available in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. In England, EMA provided weekly grants to 16 to 18 year olds from low-income households, encouraging them to stay in education after the end of their compulsory years. In its final year these grants were worth £10 to £30 a week depending on household income. In September 2011, the Coalition government replaced EMA with “16 to 19 bursaries”. These government-funded bursaries are “discretionary”, with schools broadly getting to decide which students are eligible, and how much to give them. Additionally, young people can receive a “vulnerable student bursary” of up to £1,200 per year if they are or have been in care, or are in receipt of certain benefits. In 2012/13, government-commissioned research estimated that around 360,000 students received a discretionary bursary, and 24,000 received a vulnerable student bursary. This compares to around 640,000 receiving EMA in 2009/10. When the 16 to 19 bursary fund was introduced in 2011/12, it cost “£384 million less than the 2010/11 EMA in nominal terms”. Overall, the research found that the new 16 to 19 bursaries lowered participation among students who would otherwise have received either full or partial EMA. It’s correct that the Coalition government trebled the maximum cost of tuition fees for students starting higher education in England in 2011/12. They rose from a maximum of £3,000, to £9,000. The maximum is now £9,250. You can read more about the impact of this on access to higher education here. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","
 
Correct, they went from a maximum of £3,000 to £9,000 for students beginning higher education in England in 2011/12. They’re now at £9,250.

Announced in 2003, Labour’s BSF aimed “to rebuild, refurbish and provide new Information Technology for all 3,500 secondary schools in England by 2020”. In 2009 this was estimated to cost £52 to £55 billion. By 2009, the National Audit Office reported that the speed of delivery would need to increase to complete the programme on time. “Fifty-four schools are due to open in 2009 and 121 in the following year. To start all secondary schools by 2020, the number of schools in procurement and construction at any one time will need to double over the next three years.” In July 2010, the Coalition government announced the project would be frozen “In order to ensure that we do not waste any more money on a dysfunctional process”. The Coalition government then announced its own programme (PSBP) in 2011. It aimed to rebuild and refurbish 537 “school buildings in the worst condition across the country” by 2021, and was expected to cost £4.4 billion in 2016. In 2017, the National Audit Office found that on average schools built under the new programme “are one-third cheaper per square metre than schools built under” the previous one. There were some reported concerns “about what the Department has done to reduce costs (for example, decreasing the size of communal spaces)”. Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) was ended in England by the Coalition government at the end of the year 2010/11, and replaced by a new “16 to 19 bursaries” scheme. EMA is still available in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. In England, EMA provided weekly grants to 16 to 18 year olds from low-income households, encouraging them to stay in education after the end of their compulsory years. In its final year these grants were worth £10 to £30 a week depending on household income. In September 2011, the Coalition government replaced EMA with “16 to 19 bursaries”. These government-funded bursaries are “discretionary”, with schools broadly getting to decide which students are eligible, and how much to give them. Additionally, young people can receive a “vulnerable student bursary” of up to £1,200 per year if they are or have been in care, or are in receipt of certain benefits. In 2012/13, government-commissioned research estimated that around 360,000 students received a discretionary bursary, and 24,000 received a vulnerable student bursary. This compares to around 640,000 receiving EMA in 2009/10. When the 16 to 19 bursary fund was introduced in 2011/12, it cost “£384 million less than the 2010/11 EMA in nominal terms”. Overall, the research found that the new 16 to 19 bursaries lowered participation among students who would otherwise have received either full or partial EMA. It’s correct that the Coalition government trebled the maximum cost of tuition fees for students starting higher education in England in 2011/12. They rose from a maximum of £3,000, to £9,000. The maximum is now £9,250. You can read more about the impact of this on access to higher education here. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","
 
It was removed in England at the end of the 2010/11 school year, and replaced by a new bursary scheme. Government research suggests the new scheme has lowered participation in further education among students previously eligible for EMA.

In the last eight years, the “Building schools for the future” project has been stopped.
","“If I look at the journey of the young person in my constituency, from a child to becoming an adult—children's centres had to close due to the cuts the government made over the last eight years. Then you went to school, your building schools for the future project, renewing our school buildings, stopped. You then got to further education, education maintenance allowance was taken away from you and then if you made it to university, your tuition fees were trebled. That isn’t investing in young people, that is taking away from young people.” Chuka Umunna MP, 10 May 2018 Chuka Umunna correctly identified a number of Coalition and Conservative government policies relating to young people and education. In some cases, where the government stopped a policy, they also replaced it with a new one. We take a look at each of the policies identified, and their impact, in further detail. This is not meant to be a complete assessment of the Coalition and Conservative record on youth and education. Rather, it looks specifically at the areas picked out by Mr Umunna. 508 children's centres closed in England between 2010 and August 2017, according to the government. There were around 3,600 in 2010, compared to just over 3,100 late last year. You can’t perfectly compare the number of children’s centres in 2010 and 2017 though, due to changes in how the data is recorded. There are two types of centre included in these figures. Sure Start centres provide childcare, family support and health advice to local families, and have to meet a legal definition, whereas other “children’s centres” provide some of these services, but don’t meet the legal definition. In 2010, there were around 3,630 Sure Start centres. By late 2017, the number of Sure Start centres had fallen by around 1,200. The National Audit Office found that spending by councils in England on Sure Start fell by 50% in real terms from 2010/11 to 2016/17.

329,fullfact,"800 Sure Start children’s centres have been closed in England since 2010.
","“The Tories have now closed more than 800 Sure Start centres … shutting the door in the faces of our children and their parents.” Angela Rayner MP, 27 September 2016 Sure Start centres provide childcare, family support and health advice. There are fewer of them in England now than there were before the change of government in 2010, although not all have shut their doors as such. Hundreds are still providing services, but no longer meet the official definition for a Sure Start centre. 300 or 1,000 fewer centres, depending on what you count Like previous Labour claims about Sure Start, Ms Rayner’s figure appears to come from Freedom of Information requests. The Labour Friends of Sure Start group says FOI responses show that “between 2010 and 2015, 763 Children’s Centres were closed in England”. The latest figures generally available seem to show a still greater drop, of over 1,000. There were 3,631 Sure Start centres in April 2010, in the final days of the last Labour government. In December 2015, there were 2,605. (We aren’t aware of any more recent figures.) But that’s not the end of the story. For one thing, statisticians warn that the two figures can’t be compared directly. The old ones were produced by the Department for Education; the newer ones come from lots of local authorities who all make their own corrections to the Sure Start database. More fundamentally, the answer depends on what you count. Only centres that meet the description laid down by law can be called a Sure Start Children’s Centre. But there are also additional sites that “remain open offering access to some of the early childhood services on behalf of another children's centre”. The government tends to include these additional sites in the count, and says it’s justified in doing so: ""In many cases, there has simply been a merger of management with children's centre functions still being provided on the same number of sites. It would therefore be inaccurate and misleading to claim that these figures show how many children's centres have 'closed'"". As of late 2015, there were 731 of these sites. So the change from 2010 is more like 300 than 1,000 if these are counted. It’s hard to say which figure more accurately represents the reality of reduced services. The charity 4Children used to argue (before it closed) that not all additional sites offer the same level of service as a full Sure Start centre, and so at least a couple of hundred shouldn’t be counted. That points to an answer somewhere in the middle.","This is only part of the story. There are over 1,000 fewer Sure Start centres, but only 300 fewer children’s centres overall. Around 700 sites still operate but no longer meet the official definition of a Sure Start centre.

There are more teachers.
","“We now see more teachers in our schools, we see more teachers with first class degrees in our schools.” Theresa May, 22 March 2017 The Prime Minister has made similar comments before and we found that teacher numbers generally have increased between 2010 and 2015. But the number of primary teachers has risen while the number of secondary teachers is down. We’ve asked the Department for Education if Mrs May was referring to the same time frame. There was one teacher for every 17.4 pupils across England in 2015. That’s up from 17.2 between 2011 and 2013.  That’s counting both qualified and unqualified teachers, although the trend is broadly the same if you just look at qualified teachers. Between 2011 and 2015 the pupil-teacher ratio in all state nursery and primary schools stayed the same at 20.5. In state secondary schools it went from 14.9 to 15.3. Again, this is looking across all teachers whether qualified or not. The Department for Education pointed us to initial figures suggesting that around 4,800 (or 18%) of the 26,700 new entrants to postgraduate teacher training had a first class degree in 2016/17.  These figures are still to be finalised and might change, but so far that’s the same proportion of postgraduate trainees with a first class degree as last year, although the number is slightly down. Last year there were 5,000 entrants with a first class degree. We can’t directly compare to the years before 2015/16 because the Department for Education only counted teacher training entrants via the Teach First programme from 2015/16 onwards. But we can say that between 2012/13 and 2014/15 the proportion increased from 14% to 17%.  The National Audit Office has said that “degree class is a reasonable indicator of subject knowledge but a less clear predictor of other aspects of teacher quality.” It also points out that many secondary subjects don’t have enough trainees to fill all the training places. “14 out of 17 secondary subjects had unfilled training places, compared with 2 subjects with unfilled places in 2010/11”. Not all teachers go into teacher training having already qualified in something else. Around one in six trainee teachers are undergraduates.

298,fullfact,"A third of teachers leave state education within five years of qualifying according to new figures.
","“Almost a third of teachers quit state sector within five years of qualifying”.  Guardian, 24 October 2016 “Nearly a third of teachers who began work in England's state schools in 2010 were not in the classroom five years later, official figures show.” Telegraph, 24 October 2016 “Third of teachers quit within five years of finishing training, shocking figures show”. Sun, 26 October 2016 It’s a story you may have seen.  It’s certainly been featured in almost every major newspaper this week after the figures apparently came to light when a Minister in the Department for Education  provided the information to a fellow MP. But the fact that a third of teachers leave state schools five years after qualifying isn’t new. It’s been very close to that for the last 15 years. Information on how many teachers remain in state schools in England each year after they have qualified is published annually and goes as far back as 1996. Although the number of teachers qualifying has been generally increasing since figures began in 1996, the drop-off rate after this period has remained roughly similar. There have been changes in when the data is collected, so the comparison over time isn’t perfect. The figures also don’t tell us anything about what happened to these teachers. We know they weren’t working in state schools, but they may have moved into private education or they may have given up the profession altogether. Even more simply it may also mean that the teachers have moved to work in state schools which are outside of England, but still within the UK. They might also come back to work in state schools in England again later in their career. The figures don’t tell us what proportion of teachers do this, but they do tell us that they still count teachers who don’t have “continuous service”. ","That is correct, but the figures haven’t changed a great deal for the last 15 years.

299,fullfact,"The number of people entering teacher training has increased in the last year. 
","“New figures show we have recruited more trainees than last year”—Department for Education spokesperson, 27 November 2015 “If you look at the figures this year compared with last year, we are seeing an increasing number… So in absolute terms we are increasing the number of people coming into teaching in those shortage subjects.”—Nick Gibb, Schools Minister, 9 December 2015 “New analysis shows that for every year under the Tories the number of trainee teachers recruited has fallen. The total number of trainees recruited for 2015/16 is now 7,000 fewer than for 2009/10.”—Labour party press release, 2 January 2016 The total number of people entering teacher training in England has fallen from a peak of 39,000 in 2009/10 to 32,000 in 2015/16. That includes both undergraduate and postgraduate students, and excludes entrants to Teach First. Government targets for recruitment to teacher training now focus just on postgraduate student entrants. The number of these increased in the last year, but not by enough to meet recruitment targets. These haven’t been met since 2012/13. Postgraduate entrants represented 94% of the target for 2015/16, which was an improvement on 91% in 2014/15. The total number of entrants to teacher training has fallen Overall, about 32,000 people entered teacher training in 2015/16—7,000 fewer trainees than were recruited for 2009/10. That excludes entrants to Teach First, who have been counted for the first time this year. The programme trains high-achieving graduates in challenging schools and has been expanding since 2002. Up until 2014/15, the government set recruitment targets for both undergraduate and postgraduate teacher training courses. The combined target for the two was consistently met between 2008/09 and 2011/12 but has fallen below target since then. It’s not possible to compare before 2008/09. The total number of entrants represented 91% of the target in 2014/15. Targets for 2015/16 now just focus on postgraduate entrants, something that has been criticised by Labour. The government has said that numbers of undergraduate trainees have still been taken into account when working out the targets.    The targets now also include Teach First, so any figures for 2015/16 include entrants to Teach First unless we’ve specified otherwise. Postgraduate teacher training entrants increased in the last year The number of entrants to postgraduate teacher training increased in the last year, from 26,000 in 2014/15 to 27,000 in 2015/16 (excluding Teach First). The number had been decreasing before then, from 29,000 in 2010/11 (as far back as the numbers go). Whereas the target for primary schools was met in 2015/16, the secondary schools target wasn’t. 15,000 people started postgraduate training to become a secondary school teacher that year—82% of the target. Some subjects and areas face greater shortages The numbers of postgraduate entrants to teacher training for some of the English Baccalaureate subjects, such as sciences, languages and geography, were particularly low compared to the targets in 2015/16. Science recruits made up 85% of the target, while language recruits and geography recruits made up 87% and 83% respectively. That’s despite an increase in the numbers of recruits onto those programmes. This was offset by significant increases in the targets for some subjects in 2015/16. For example, the target for training for science teachers increased by 30% from 2,500 entrants in 2014/15 to 3,300 in 2015/16. There aren’t any regional targets for trainee recruitment. To get a sense of regional teacher supply, the National Audit Office (NAO) compared the number of trainees in each area to the number of pupils, on the assumption that many people will go on to teach close to where they have trained. Numbers of trainees vary quite substantially on this basis. In 2015/16, the North West had 547 people training in the area per 100,000 pupils, while the East of England had 294 trainees per 100,000 pupils, according to the NAO’s figures. The accuracy of the targets has been questioned The government’s targets for trainee teacher numbers come from the Department for Education’s teacher supply model. The NAO says the model is carefully thought through but it has raised a number of concerns about its accuracy. Some of the unreliability of the estimates can’t be helped. The calculations have to incorporate uncertain predictions of future pupil numbers (which are affected by things like immigration) and of future economic circumstances (which are also notoriously difficult to predict). But the NAO argued the model lacked a good enough understanding of teacher shortages and said it ignored pre-existing teacher shortages, such as where previous recruitment targets had been missed. Overall the NAO said that the number of teachers schools need and the quality of those in post is unclear. It pointed to evidence that schools in “apparently similar circumstances” employ very different numbers of teachers. Primary schools with about 210 children in well off areas may have 12 full-time equivalent teachers or as few as seven, according to its figures.   This is part of a series of factchecks we are doing on the supply of teachers in England. We will also be looking at topics such as the number of teachers, the number of vacancies and the use of supply teachers in schools.","The number of people entering postgraduate teacher training increased in the last year, but is below target. The overall number of people entering at undergraduate and postgraduate level has fallen.

336,fullfact,"Most secondary schools use teachers not trained in their subject
","“Most secondary schools ‘use teachers not trained in their subject’” The Independent, 1 March 2016 Two-thirds of people responding to a survey conducted by the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said recruitment problems have led them to have subjects taught by non-specialists. The survey wasn’t designed to be nationally representative, so we don’t know what the national figure is. ASCL says its members work in over 90% of secondary schools in the UK, so we do at least know that a wide spread of school leaders were asked to take part. About 6% of those asked chose to. Official statistics show the proportion of classes being taught in secondary schools by teachers without a relevant post A level qualification has been rising. This was the case for about 18% of English Baccalaureate subjects in 2014—up from 14% in 2010. We won’t have the figures for 2015 until June. Majority of respondents said they had recruited non-specialists 789 people—89%—responding to ASCL’s survey said they were experiencing difficulties recruiting teachers. When asked what actions they had taken because of problems recruiting, 595 people said they had “subjects taught by non-specialists”. That was 73% of the people responding to that question, and 67% of all people taking part (885). There’s some fluctuation in the responses. More people answered the question about what actions they had taken due to problems recruiting (817 people) than said they were having problems recruiting (789 people). We can’t say why this is. The survey wasn’t designed to be nationally representative These results aren’t weighted by things like where respondents’ schools were located to match this up with the geographical spread of schools nationally.  If respondents were more heavily based in certain areas this could make quite a big difference to the results (either by inflating them or deflating them) as we know that there are localised differences in recruitment.   ASCL says the majority of respondents were from secondary schools. The survey was sent to all 15,000 of ASCL’s full members, who include head teachers, deputy head teachers and managers in schools and colleges. About 6% took part. We don’t know how typical the leaders responding were of all secondary schools. The fact that they chose to take part in the survey might mean that they had distinct experiences to those who didn’t. Some of them might also have been responding from the same school. More hours are being taught by non-specialist teachers The proportion of lessons being taught in secondary schools by teachers without a relevant post A level qualification in the subject has grown in the official figures. In maths, about 16% of lessons were taught by teachers with no relevant post A level qualifications in 2010 (the furthest back these figures go), rising to 20% in 2014. In English, the equivalent figure rose from 12% in 2010 to 17% in 2014. Taking all the English Baccalaureate subjects together (English, maths, sciences, languages, history and geography), the proportion rose from 14% in 2010 to 18% in 2014, according to the National Audit Office (NAO). The proportion of teachers in each subject without relevant post A level qualifications has also grown. More English, maths and science teachers lacked the relevant qualifications for their subjects in 2014 compared to 2013. About 24% of maths teachers and 21% of English teachers lacked relevant post A level qualifications for their subject in 2014. We don’t have the statistics yet for 2015. The timing of these statistics—which are collected in November every year—may affect these results. There are fewer vacancies in teaching posts in November, according to the NAO, so this may also affect these statistics. ","Two-thirds of people responding to a survey by a school and college leaders’ union said recruitment problems have led them to have subjects taught by non-specialists. We don’t know how representative that figure is of the experience of schools nationally. Official figures show that about one in six lessons in the key academic subjects in English secondary schools were being taught by teachers without a relevant post A level qualification in 2014. Around 24% of maths teachers and 21% of English teachers didn’t have a relevant post A level qualification in that year.

300,fullfact,"The overall teacher vacancy rate is 0.3% and has remained under 1% for the past 15 years. 
","“The overall teacher vacancy rate is 0.3% and has remained under 1% for the past 15 years.” Department for Education spokesperson, 14 December 2015 The government has said that teacher recruitment in certain subjects and in certain parts of the country is challenging, but it has regularly pointed to figures to show that the overall number of school vacancies is still low. It’s correct that the statistics on English school vacancies remain low, with 0.3% of all teaching posts sitting vacant in 2014. But that proportion has risen since 2012, albeit from a low figure. The government has said that it realises the data will not properly reflect the reality felt by schools, according to the National Audit Office. One reason for that is that the statistics are gathered in November, when vacancies are low compared to the rest of the academic year. The vacancy rate is low, but has been rising There were around 1,000 vacancies for full-time permanent teachers in English state-funded schools in 2014. That’s 0.3% of all regular full-time qualified teachers, so according to this data it’s still relatively low. But the number has been rising. The number has risen from around 400 in each of the three years from 2010 to 2012, when the rate stayed at 0.1%. These are teaching posts that are either empty or have been filled by a temporary teacher on a contract of less than one term. As the government spokesperson says, the rate hasn’t gone above 1% since at least 2000, which is as far back as the statistics go. The figures for 2000-2010 are slightly different to the figures for 2010 and beyond. They show vacancies in local authority schools, whereas the newer figures here look at all state-funded schools including academies. And the vacancies were counted at a different time of year. The number of posts that have been filled temporarily has also been increasing since 2010, from 1,800 to 3,200. These are posts held by teachers on contracts of anywhere between one term and up to one year. As a proportion of all posts in state-funded schools in England, that is an increase from 0.5% to 0.9%. So there were 4,200 posts that were either vacant or temporarily filled in 2014—1.2% of all teaching posts. That’s double the overall proportion from 2010, when it was 0.6%. Secondary schools have slightly more vacancies than primary schools. The highest vacancy rates (including temporarily filled posts) were seen in IT—where it was 1.5%—and in maths, the sciences, and the social sciences, where it was 1.4%. Yorkshire and The Humber, Inner London and the South East have slightly higher vacancy rates (excluding temporarily filled posts) than the rest of England. We won’t know the figures for the start of the current academic year until this coming June. The data doesn’t tell us exactly what’s going on  In a report on teacher training the NAO has said that: “It is difficult on the basis of current data to quantify accurately the extent to which shortages exist”. The government has said that the data on vacancies and temporarily filled positions are unlikely to reflect recruitment difficulties fully, according to the same report. One reason for this is that the statistics on vacancies are gathered each November. The NAO says vacancies are comparatively low at this time of year, so the statistics may not properly represent the vacancies seen at other times of the academic year. We’ve asked the NAO if it can tell us the other reason or reasons. Surveys suggest schools are experiencing difficulties with recruitment A significant proportion of school leaders have reported having difficulties recruiting teachers, according to surveys pointed to by the NAO. Labour has previously referred to a survey conducted by the TES Global education company in 2015, where 46% of nearly 250 responding head teachers said they had unfilled positions in their schools. It’s not clear how this survey was carried out and so how representative it is of all head teachers. We’ve contacted the TES to find out.

301,fullfact,"Record numbers of teachers are quitting the profession, more than entered the profession.
","""…record numbers of teachers are quitting the profession—50,000 this year, more than actually entered the profession."" Shadow Education Secretary Lucy Powell, 14 December 2015 In terms of actual numbers entering and leaving the profession, slightly more people left teaching roles in state-funded schools in 2014 than entered it. 49,110 qualified teachers left and 48,870 joined. 13,000 of those who left retired. So these aren't necessarily all teachers who might consider themselves as having ""quit"" in the sense of leaving the job because they're fed up of it or because they want a different one. This is important to consider in the context of Labour's claim that Ministers have ""constantly talked down the profession, causing thousands of teachers to quit"". The Conservatives have reportedly argued that it's ""disingenuous"" to include retirees in this context. Of those who haven't retired, about one in six move to private schools, according to analysis by the National Foundation for Educational Research. So not all of these teachers are stopping teaching completely. We've got more detail on the destinations for the leavers in a separate factcheck. All data here relates to qualified teachers unless otherwise stated. Record numbers entering and leaving Regardless of whether you include or exclude retirees, the number of teachers leaving state-funded schools is the highest since 2011 (when comparable records began). That's not unique to those leaving—the number entering these schools is also the highest since 2011. So far, there have been enough entrants to mean that the total number of teachers (full time equivalent) in the state-funded sector has been increasing. We can't compare back before 2011 because the statistics were measured differently then, including at a different time of year. Rates of entries and leavers have been fairly similar The other way to look at the gap between teachers entering and leaving is through the 'entry rate' and 'wastage rate'. That's the number of teachers entering and leaving state-funded schools as a proportion of all teachers in those schools. The entry rate was just under 10% in 2014, while the wastage rate was 9 or 10% depending on whether you're interested in headcount or the full-time equivalent measure. These rates have remained broadly around the 10% mark over the last few years (and between March 2005 and March 2011, when the data was collected differently).  On the broader question of whether this demonstrates a teacher ""recruitment crisis"", as Labour and others have argued, this set of data is one of many that can be looked at. We'll have a more detailed analysis looking at the variety of data available on this soon.","Slightly more people left teaching roles in state-funded schools in 2014 than entered them. Those that left include over one in four who retired, so not all of these people are ""quitting"" teaching in favour of a different job. The numbers of teachers leaving and entering state-funded schools in England in 2014 were the highest since 2011 (when records began).

302,fullfact,"A relentless workload is forcing teachers to leave the profession for lower paid jobs.
","""'Relentless' workload forcing 'desperate' teachers to leave profession with big pay cuts"" TES, 1 December 2015 New research has found that, over the last 15 years, people who left teaching roles in state schools took up on average lower paid jobs. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), quoted in the TES' headline, said that's due to the relentless nature of the workload and pressure. The research didn't look at why teachers are leaving for lower paid jobs. Polling suggests workload is a significant factor for teachers wanting to leave, but we don't know that it's the main reason why some teachers are prepared to leave for lower paid jobs specifically. The research said there could be any number of reasons. The analysis looks at short-term job transitions. Over the longer term, it points out, some of these jobs may become better paid than teaching jobs. For example, if teachers are changing career they may well start off on a lower wage while they're developing new skills. Reasons for taking lower-paid jobs are unclear The research, conducted by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER), explains that teachers leaving state schools for a lower paid job may be leaving for any number of reasons, such as reasons relating to their previous job (which could include workload), personal factors (e.g. health problems) and changes in job circumstances for their family. That's not to say that workload isn't a significant factor for teachers wanting to leave and actually leaving. But we don't know if it's making teachers willing to take up lower-paid jobs specifically. Workload came top (61%) in reasons given by teachers who were thinking of leaving the profession in a recent YouGov survey for the National Union of Teachers, closely followed by seeking a better work-life balance (57%). This echoes findings from another YouGov poll, this time for the education company Pearson, which found workload was the most important reason among those who had considered leaving in the last six months. Lower wages seen among teaching assistants and public sector workers Excluding those leaving the profession to retire, the research found just over half of people leaving teaching roles in the state sector moved to other jobs in the wider school sector—such as teaching in private schools, becoming teaching assistants and taking up non-teaching roles in schools. So in the case of those moving to private schools, they're not entirely leaving the profession. It looks at employment survey data over a 15 year period, so this is a long term view. The report doesn't comment on the potential reasons behind moving to each type of job; some of them will be less workload intense than others. It was the people who left to become teaching assistants or to work in the public sector (for example in colleges or universities) who saw a substantial drop in their wages—a fall of around 25-30% compared to similar people who stayed. Those who moved to private schools, non-teaching roles in schools and private sector jobs didn't have a significantly different salary to their equivalents who were still teaching in state schools. Part-time teachers and those over the age of 50 are more likely to leave Part-time teachers and those over the age of 50 were more likely to leave, while teachers with leadership positions were less likely to leave. The research also found over the 15 year period a greater turnover among secondary school teachers—with teachers more likely to join secondary schools but also more likely to leave secondary schools than primaries. Using different data and looking over the last four years it finds individuals are more likely to join primary schools.","Research found people leaving teaching roles in state schools are ending up in jobs which are on average lower paid, at least in their first year. It's not clear to what extent workload pressures are encouraging teachers to leave for lower paid jobs specifically.

303,fullfact,"The head of Ofsted wants schools to discriminate on the basis of race when hiring teachers.
","""Discriminate against white teachers to ensure 'ethnic mix', says Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw"" - Daily Telegraph, 7 January 2015 Several newspapers, as well as the BBC, have reported on comments made by the Chief Inspector of Schools in England, suggesting that he supports ""positive discrimination"" in recruiting teachers. Sir Michael Wilshaw said, in the context of ensuring that teaching staff reflect the ethnic diversity of their pupils, that ""If I had two people applying for a job of equal merit and I felt we needed to increase the number of teachers from ethnic minority backgrounds to the staff then I would apply positive discrimination—as long as the two people were of equal merit."" The Department for Education has responded that ""positive discrimination is not permitted"" by law. So did Sir Michael advocate illegal hiring practices? An employer cannot refuse to hire someone who is qualified just because they are white. The Equality Act 2010 prohibits discrimination against people on the basis of various characteristics, including race (which includes colour, nationality and ethnicity). This includes discrimination in employment. The Act does, however, permit what it calls 'positive action' in employment. This essentially means that employers who reasonably think a group of people are disadvantaged because of a 'protected characteristic' (such as race) can take steps to help them ""overcome or minimise that disadvantage"". But when it comes to hiring or promoting people, this 'positive action' is only allowed when choosing between people that are equally qualified for a job. In addition, employers can't have a general policy of automatically favouring people who share a protected characteristic, by applying less stringent standards to them or enforcing a hiring quota. When it comes to hiring decisions, positive action can only be used as a ""tie-breaker"". As the Law Society puts it: ""Positive action is not ... positive discrimination or quotas. These are unlawful"". Positive discrimination would mean hiring less qualified people because they are from an ethnic minority, which the Act makes clear isn't allowed. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is an example of how positive discrimination (rather than positive action) operates. It used to apply a hiring quota so that half of recruits meeting minimum requirements had to be Roman Catholics. This required specific legislation; the Equality Act (which doesn't apply to Northern Ireland anyway) wouldn't allow it normally. So it's clear that what Sir Michael described is a legal approach: remedying the problem— in his view—of having too few ethnic minority teachers on staff by using race as a tie-breaker between two candidates of equal merit. It's 'positive action'—he just labelled it, a little loosely, as 'positive discrimination'. And given the specific scenario he outlines, there is nothing to suggest that he favours any change in the law to allow actual positive discrimination.","Sir Michael Wilshaw said that in some cases, he would hire an equally qualified person from an ethnic minority over another. But in law, this isn't 'discrimination'.

338,fullfact,"72% of free schools are located in areas with a shortage of places. 
","""72% [of free schools] are located in areas with a shortage of places"" Department for Education, 22 May 2015  Originally the approval of a free school application was dependent on parental demand, rather than specifically whether the area was in need of more school places. This policy led Labour politicians to criticise the building of new free schools in areas with surplus places. Basic need for school places now makes up one of the three key factors which determine whether a free school application gets approved. By the start of the 2014/15 academic year (September 2014), 75% of open or approved free schools were in areas with an expected need, according to analysis by the Department for Education (DfE). Looking just at those already open, seven in ten are in areas with a need for additional places. 7 in 10 in or near areas in need of more school places DfE told us the 72% relates to open mainstream free schools, so excludes schools that have been approved but not yet opened, special schools, alternative provision and schools for 16-19 year olds. The published analysis doesn't give this exact figure—stating instead that seven in ten open free schools were in areas needing more places. In order to calculate need in the local area, DfE told us they took the expected pupil numbers for 2015/16, and compared this to the number of school places in May 2013. There has since been newer data for the number of school places (for May 2014) but the department has not re-run the analysis since then so the seven in ten is the latest official figure. These overall figures relate to capacity at the local authority district level, in contrast to the newer rounds of free school applications which are based on ""planning areas"". Planning areas are smaller than local authority district and exist to aid local authorities in planning pupil places. A school is deemed as being built in an area of need if it is in or ""immediately adjacent"" to planning areas with a need for more places.  DfE says this means its figures on the need for places are more reflective of the real area ""from which a free school is most likely to draw its pupils"". This doesn't mean these areas will immediately see their capacity increase Many free schools do not immediately operate at full capacity. For example, they might start by just admitting year 7 pupils at first, then year 7 and 8 in the next year, and so on. So not all of the places in these schools will be available straight away.","DfE analysis shows 7 in 10 open free schools are (or 75% of open and approved free schools). Many of the schools won't be operating at full capacity yet.

339,fullfact,"Free schools improve neighbouring schools. 
","""Free Schools don't just raise the performance of their own pupils—they raise standards in surrounding schools in the area too"" David Cameron, 9 March 2015 Free schools are once again in the headlines, with the Prime Minister promising more under a future Conservative government. The announcement earlier this week coincided with publication of a report on the impact of free schools by Policy Exchange, an independent educational charity, which concludes: ""Free Schools are raising standards for other pupils across their local communities, especially in some of the poorest performing schools."" This is a strong claim given the limitations of the evidence, especially the small numbers of schools involved in the research. The report notes that performance improves in weaker schools, but ""higher performing schools make less progress and the very highest drop back."" These important points seem to have got lost in the discussion that followed, and are not reflected in Policy Exchange's headline conclusion and the Prime Minister's claim. Do free schools raise standards in other schools? To answer this question, Policy Exchange looks at a new free school and finds the three nearest similar schools. They do this for all free schools approved in a particular year, and track the progress of those nearby schools from the year the free school is approved up to 2014. We're talking about small groups here: typically between 20 and 30 free schools of each type open each year; that means comparing between 60 and 90 neighbouring schools. We'd expect figures to be quite variable given these small sample sizes and Policy Exchange advise treating the results with caution. For secondary schools that were performing worse than average, those with a free school nearby improved more than similarly-attaining schools nationally. But by the same measure, successful schools with a free school nearby improved less than other such schools nationally. These effects cancel each other out so overall neighbouring schools perform in line with the national level. The picture is similar for primary schools near free schools: the lowest-performing made more progress while higher performing schools made less progress than would be expected nationally. Policy Exchange told us: ""We make it very clear — in the report and in press interviews — that there seems to be a pattern suggesting free schools raise standards for neighbouring schools, especially in the most underperforming schools. We have not said that free schools lift results for every school in a local authority."" There is no proof that free schools themselves were the cause of any change in performance in other schools nearby. Policy Exchange suggests that free schools might be raising standards through competition with local schools. But there's nothing in this argument specific to free schools: local competition could also be achieved by opening a new maintained school or academy in the area, or by the arrival of a new headteacher in an existing school. The report doesn't compare the effects of new free schools with other new schools, so there's nothing to show whether free schools are necessarily better. Do free schools raise standards for themselves? As we've said previously, it's too early to say whether free schools fare better than other schools under Ofsted inspections. Just 76 schools, less than a third of the total, have been inspected and given judgements so far. That figure excludes two free schools which were judged inadequate before later closing. Of those that are open, not enough free schools have exam results yet to begin comparing them to other schools. Keeping free schools in perspective Free schools are only a small part of the picture, with just over 250 currently open out of more than 24,000 schools in England. As the Education Select Committee pointed out, even opening a further 500 free schools would only bring the proportion to 3% of all schools in England, and that assumes that no other schools open in the same period, which seems unlikely given the projected increases in primary and secondary student populations. After digesting ten sessions of oral evidence and around 140 written submissions, the Education Select Committee reported in January 2015 that: ""it is too early to draw conclusions on the quality of education provided by free schools or their broader system impact"" Education Select Committee, 21 January 2015 That's the fairest summary of the evidence we've seen so far.","Near new free schools, bad schools tend to get better and good schools tend to get worse but the evidence doesn't prove that free schools are the cause.

340,fullfact,"Around half of free schools are in the 30% most deprived communities in the country. 
","""Around half [of free schools] are in the 30% most deprived communities in the country"". Department for Education, 2 September 2015 The Prime Minister vowed an unwavering commitment to expanding the number of free schools today, as it was announced that applications have been approved for the first 18 free schools of this Parliament. Among the claims made about the success of free schools included this one about how many are in deprived areas. The publicly available figures show just under 45% of open mainstream free schools (excluding three without location data) are located in the 30% most deprived communities in England. Including free schools for 16-19 year olds, and special and alternative provision free schools, the figure comes to about 47%. The nitty gritty of the calculations The latest deprivation data we have for England is for 2008. Areas are given a score based on a number of indicators including residents' incomes, employment, health and education. Each area is ranked according to its score, and from that we've worked out which areas are considered to be among the most deprived 30%. The areas used are at the ""Lower layer Super Output Area"" (LSOA) level. These are small areas containing about 1,500 residents each. We then used the Department's own data on which areas free schools are in to count how many of the schools fall into the most deprived 30%. Doing this requires a bit of data cross-referencing—the deprivation data only tells you the LSOA's unique code and not its name, while the Department's data links schools to the LSOA name, but not the code. Once matched up (using this spreadsheet) the data shows that 44.6% (104) of 233 open free schools can be counted as being in one of these most deprived areas. This excludes three schools for which no LSOA data is published. The Department told us its calculations were based on internal data and include free schools opening this month. It said the internal data may identify a school as belonging to a different LSOA, for example if it had moved. It said this may explain any discrepancy between our figure and its figure of ""around half"". We're waiting to hear back from the Department with the exact percentage from its calculations. New deprivation data is being published at the end of September which may change which areas are counted as being the most deprived 30% and so how many free schools are in such areas.","Based on the available data (including deprivation data from 2008), just under 45% of open mainstream free schools are.

304,fullfact,"120,000 more six year olds are passing the phonics screening check.
","""Worth it for the 120,000 more 6-year-olds on track to become confident readers as a result of our focus on phonics"". Nicky Morgan, Education Secretary, 3 November 2015 The proportion of six year olds in England reaching the expected level in the phonics screening check (PSC) has increased by 19 percentage points from 2012 to 2015—the equivalent of 120,000 more children meeting the standard in 2015. The proportion increased from 58% in 2012, to 77% in 2015. The focus on phonics Phonics involves teaching children how to recognise the sounds that individual letters make and the sounds that combinations of letters make (such as 'sh' and 'oo') and to then combine these sounds to make a word. The Coalition government introduced the PSC for teachers to identify children who have not yet fully grasped this style of reading and who are in need of extra support. Alongside a matched funding scheme, the check was part of a drive to promote a greater use of phonics teaching. The introduction of the check, and the focus on phonics, has not been without controversy: for example, the NUT teachers union has described it as ""testing nonsense"". In the check pupils are asked to read 40 words designed to test their phonics skills. To meet the expected standard, pupils need at least 32 out of 40 marks. Teachers report teaching phonics at a greater pace While teachers' views on the check itself were mixed in a recent evaluation by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) for the Department for Education (DfE) (although they were also found to be positive about phonics generally), there was evidence that they've changed the way they teach phonics since the test was introduced. For example, many teachers reported that they're now teaching phonics at a greater pace. The report said that this suggested there was a link between the change in teaching in phonics and the improved performance of pupils in the check. As NFER cautions though, it's difficult to single out the introduction of the check as a cause for anything as it was introduced to all schools at the same time, meaning that there aren't any schools without the check to compare them to. Similarly it's hard to single out the effect of the government's ""focus on phonics"" as there's been a gradual increase in teaching in phonics. Unclear if the focus is improving pupils' reading and writing skills As for whether there's any evidence that pupils' reading and writing skills are improving as a result of this focus on phonics, that's less clear. Pupils were found to be unlikely to achieve the expected standard in reading and writing at key stage one (7-11) if they hadn't passed the phonics check. But NFER's research was inconclusive on whether the introduction of the check had been the cause of improved literacy performance in kids at key stage one—their performance was improving both before and after the check was introduced (and so before and after more kids were passing the expected standard in phonics). Ofsted has commented that the emphasis on phonics is having a big effect—Head of Ofsted Sir Michael Wilshaw recently said that phonics is one of the most significant factors in the improvement of primary schools.","The proportion of six year olds reaching the expected level in phonics screening check has increased by 19 percentage points from 2012 to 2015 - the equivalent of 120,000 more children meeting the standard in 2015.

And the majority have been opened, actually, in areas of disadvantage—where they are helping the very children we want to see getting the opportunity to get on in life.”  Theresa May, 8 March 2017 Rising pupil numbers will mean that 420,000 new school places are needed in primary and secondary schools across England between 2016 and 2021, according the National Audit Office. Around 232,000 will be in primary schools and 189,000 in secondary schools. There were almost 600,000 new school places created between 2010 and 2015. Around 20% of these came from free schools. That rises to 43% if you just look at new secondary school places. It’s also correct that the majority of free schools have been opened in areas where there is a need for it. 83% of new free schools approved since 2013 were in areas where there was a local need for places. The National Audit Office also says that “the Department [for Education] estimates that 56,000 of the 113,500 new places in mainstream free schools opening between 2015 and 2021 will contribute to meeting local demographic need for new places”. We’ve asked the Department for Education what the Prime Minister was referring to when she said that the majority of free schools had been opened in disadvantaged areas. In September last year the government said that 48% of the 344 free schools which had been opened up until that point were in the most deprived 30% of areas in England.  Overall spending on mainstream schools, including free schools, is set to increase from £35 billion in 2015/16 to £38 billion in 2019/20. At the same time, spending per pupil is expected to decrease by 6.5% according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, taking account of inflation.

The National Audit Office has said that 420,000 new school places are needed.
","“The National Audit Office tell us that a very large number of new school places are needed—420,000… At the same time, per pupil spending is falling in real terms.” Jeremy Corbyn, 8 March 2017 “The majority of free schools that have been opened, have been opened in areas where there’s a need for school places. And the majority have been opened, actually, in areas of disadvantage—where they are helping the very children we want to see getting the opportunity to get on in life.”  Theresa May, 8 March 2017 Rising pupil numbers will mean that 420,000 new school places are needed in primary and secondary schools across England between 2016 and 2021, according the National Audit Office. Around 232,000 will be in primary schools and 189,000 in secondary schools. There were almost 600,000 new school places created between 2010 and 2015. Around 20% of these came from free schools. That rises to 43% if you just look at new secondary school places. It’s also correct that the majority of free schools have been opened in areas where there is a need for it. 83% of new free schools approved since 2013 were in areas where there was a local need for places. The National Audit Office also says that “the Department [for Education] estimates that 56,000 of the 113,500 new places in mainstream free schools opening between 2015 and 2021 will contribute to meeting local demographic need for new places”. We’ve asked the Department for Education what the Prime Minister was referring to when she said that the majority of free schools had been opened in disadvantaged areas. In September last year the government said that 48% of the 344 free schools which had been opened up until that point were in the most deprived 30% of areas in England.  Overall spending on mainstream schools, including free schools, is set to increase from £35 billion in 2015/16 to £38 billion in 2019/20. At the same time, spending per pupil is expected to decrease by 6.5% according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, taking account of inflation. This rises to 8% when comparing 2014/15 to 2019/20 and taking account of increasing costs of things like staff pension schemes, according to the National Audit Office.

342,fullfact,"Free schools are being opened in areas that do not need them.
","“There is evidence that certain free schools are being opened in areas that do not need them, and my view is that there should be equality, that money should be spread right across the system to give every child a good school in the area where he lives.” BBC Question Time audience member, 23 February 2017 “With respect, sir, shouldn't we leave it to the parents of the children to decide if those free schools are needed because by definition you can't open a free school unless there is a need for it.” Douglas Carswell, 23 February 2017 To set up a free school in England you need to show that there’s support from parents, and either a basic shortage of places or a lack of good school places in the area. So in one sense Mr Carswell is right. The fact that a free school has been approved implies that there’s bottom-up demand and the Department for Education has agreed there’s a need. But that ‘need’ isn’t always a basic need for more places.  It is much of the time. 83% of free schools since 2013 were started in areas that didn’t have enough school places, according to the Department for Education. But not all of them were. As the National Audit Office point out, 46 secondary free schools (21% of the total) are in council areas which haven’t needed more places overall since 2009/10, and won’t need more up to 2019/20. Free schools can also be approved if the standard of local schools is poor, judged either in terms of poor Ofsted ratings or pupil performance. Half of new places in mainstream free schools opening between 2015 and 2021 will help meet a shortage in the area, according to estimates from the Department for Education. It expects the other half to create spare capacity in the local schools system. And that’s part of the plan. One idea behind the Free Schools Programme is that giving parents more choice increases competition between schools and drives up standards overall. If new free schools prove more popular with parents then they’ll draw away pupils from other schools, and those pupils take government funding with them. For now, too few free schools have been running long enough to say whether this works in practice, according to the National Audit Office. There isn’t enough data to say whether free schools push standards in other local schools up or down. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","It depends what you mean by ‘need’. 83% of free schools since 2013 have been opened in areas that need extra school places, but free schools can also be opened with the intention of driving up standards. Across this parliament, the Department for Education expects about half of new places in mainstream free schools to create spare capacity in their local area.

20,fullfact,"The country’s most senior judge has said that women shouldn’t be able to wear veils in criminal trials.
","“Women should not be allowed to cover their faces with veils in criminal trials, Britain’s most senior judge has said” The Times, 30 January 2016 The Times reports that Lord Neuberger, the President of the Supreme Court, thinks that women who wear veils should be asked to remove them when giving evidence in criminal cases. The Court confirmed that this is an accurate reflection of the judge’s position. It’s not a challenge to the current approach, as judges can already ask women to remove veils. Previous reports about this issue haven’t been so accurate. The Times says (£) that these are Lord Neuberger’s “first comments” on the subject—but you’ll find stories from last year about how the same judge supports women appearing in court under a veil. As we pointed out at the time, Lord Neuberger didn’t say that, and denied that he had. The speech that generated the headlines called for: “understanding as to how people from different cultural, social, religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave. Well known examples include... how some women find it inappropriate to appear in public with their face uncovered.""  This didn’t tell us what the President thought about whether veils should be allowed. Now we do know what he thinks: “I can see serious difficulties with the idea that a witness should have her head covered where evidence is contested. If there is any question of credibility, it should be uncovered. “The jury system works in this country by contested evidence being decided by witnesses giving evidence before a jury and having credibility weighed—and one factor taken into account is the impression the witness makes and that includes being able to see the witness’s face.” We checked with the Supreme Court, which confirmed that Lord Neuberger made his comments in the course of an interview with the Times’s legal editor. He doesn’t suggest that veils should be banned in court altogether. None of this affects people who want to watch a trial—whether involved in it or not—while wearing a veil. The issue is only when the focus of the judge or jury is on a veiled witness. Lord Neuberger also backed the current “case-by-case system” for deciding on veils, saying that guidance for judges that was promised in 2013 doesn’t seem necessary. Judges have said in the past that they’ll order veils to be removed if they have to.","Correct. The head of the Supreme Court said that witnesses whose evidence is being challenged should have to remove a veil covering their face.

21,fullfact,"A senior judge has said that Muslim women should be allowed to wear a veil in court. 
","Muslim women should be allowed to wear the veil in court, top judge suggests—Daily Telegraph, 17 April 2015 Britain's top judge says Muslim women should be allowed to wear veil in court—Daily Express, 17 April 2015 A speech given by the President of the Supreme Court on 10 April has led to claims that the judge supports allowing Muslim women to wear a face-covering veil in court. Lord Neuberger denies that he said any such thing. What did he actually say? His speech was delivered on ""Fairness in the Courts"". In it, Lord Neuberger suggests what judges might do to ensure that the court system has the confidence of the public. One of these things is to ""show... respect to everybody equally"". ""That requires some understanding as to how people from different cultural, social, religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave. Well known examples include... how some women find it inappropriate to appear in public with their face uncovered."" That's been interpreted as indicating support for Muslim women to keep their faces covered in the public setting of a courtroom. But clearly the speech doesn't actually say that, and it can't change the law. Neither the speech nor the follow-up statement explains whether Lord Neuberger has a view either way. What does the court system usually say? Guidance for judges published in 2007 described the veil, or niqab, as ""an important element of... religious and cultural identity"" for women who wear it. It said that ""for the judicial system the starting point should be respect for the choice made, and for each woman to decide on the extent and nature of the dress she adopts"". A tribunal decision in 2014 noted that ""in an increasingly multi-ethnic and culturally diverse society... issues concerning attire and symbols motivated by religious belief and conviction must be handled by all judicial bodies with great tact and sensitivity"". What are the rules on veils in court? Muslim women don't have an unrestricted right to wear a veil in court (although they are free to in daily life, unlike in other countries). Judges generally consider that being able to see the faces of the people involved in a case can be important for a fair trial. When someone is giving evidence, in particular, a High Court judgment has described being able to see their facial expression as ""essential to assess accuracy and credibility"". There aren't any hard and fast legal rules on how to reconcile these competing interests. More specific guidance for judges was promised in 2013, but doesn't seem to have materialised. For the time being, judges deal with this tricky situation as they see fit—sometimes using solutions such as ""limited screening or minimising the courtroom audience"", as judges in a recent case recommended. Are these compromises legal? These solutions are backed up by a legal decision, but it's not definitive. The most concrete statement of the law is the judgment of a Crown Court judge in September 2013. Judge Peter Murphy pointed out that everyone has ""freedom of conscience, freedom of religion, and freedom of religious expression. These rights are protected by the Common Law"", as well as the European Convention on Human Rights (which is also part of the UK's law). But: ""If a fair trial is to take place, the jury (and for some limited purposes, the judge) must be able to assess the credibility of the witnesses—to judge how they react to being questioned"". Ultimately, he decided that if wearing a veil ""interferes to an unacceptable degree with the Court's ability to conduct a trial which is fair to all parties"", it would have to be removed. His solution was that ""the defendant is free to wear the niqaab during trial... [but] if the defendant gives evidence, she must remove the niqaab throughout her evidence"". When unveiled, a screen could be set up to shield her from public view—but not from the judge, jury or lawyers taking part. Is this the last word? The Crown Court doesn't set binding legal precedents. Judge Murphy expressed the hope in 2013 that Parliament or a higher court (such as Lord Neuberger's) would settle the question. Until that happens, it's likely that case-by-case compromises will continue.","Lord Neuberger said that judges should understand why people wear a veil. He didn't call for a specific change to the law which allows veils to be restricted.

262,fullfact,"190,000 Muslim women, or 22%, speak little or no English.
","""New figures show that some 190,000 British Muslim women—or 22%—speak little or no English despite many having lived here for decades. 40,000 of these women speak no English at all."" David Cameron, 18 January 2016 “The figures—you’ve mentioned 22%—the figures are very very difficult to understand, because the Runnymede Trust has done some research and it indicates that 6% of Muslim women can’t speak English or have little English. So it’d be interesting to see where those figures come from because it’s certainly not figures that organisations like the [Muslim Council of Britain] and Runnymede recognise.” Dal Babu, former police officer, 18 January 2016 The government’s figures seem to be correct for England, at least according to the 2011 census. The alternative 6% figure, from the Muslim Council of Britain, isn’t measuring the same thing. Claim accurate according to new analysis of relatively old data There were around 846,000 Muslim women aged 16 or older living in England as of the 2011 census. Of these, almost exactly 190,000, or 22%, said that they could speak English “not well” (152,000) or “not at all” (38,000). These 190,000 Muslim women are part of the 863,000 people in total who said they couldn’t speak English well or at all that year. 90,000 Muslim men, or 10%, said the same.      6% alternative may not count all Muslims who can’t speak English well An alternative figure of 6% rather than 22% was offered by a contributor to the Today programme, citing the Runnymede Trust. When we asked, Runnymede referred us to a report by the Muslim Council of Britain, rather than anything it published itself. At the time this report was published, in January 2015, the analysis the government used today wasn’t available. The standard census tables don’t break down English language ability by religion. The Muslim Council of Britain looked instead at people living in England and Wales who were born in Pakistan or Bangladesh. It found that one in four reported speaking English not very well or not at all. The Council compared this with the total Muslim population to get a figure of 6%. It says that those born in Pakistan or Bangladesh group of people represents “those most likely to be Muslim and also most likely to struggle with the English language”. So for the 6% figure to be accurate, we’d have to assume that no Muslim apart from those born in Pakistan or Bangladesh struggles with English. The analysis also isn’t specific to “women”. It’s taking people of both genders, aged three and up. So it doesn’t rebut the government’s claim.

65,fullfact,"Adult education has been cut by 35% during David Cameron’s time as Prime Minister. 
","“Could I kindly bring him back to the question I asked from Callum, and point out to him that… adult education has been cut by 35% during his time as Prime Minister?” Jeremy Corbyn, 9 March 2016 Spending on core adult skills—including classroom and workplace based learning and adult apprenticeships for people aged 19 and over—is down. It fell by about 35% between 2009/10 and 2015/16 according to membership body the Association of Colleges. That doesn’t account for inflation—the fall is about 41% accounting for it. Jeremy Corbyn and the Prime Minister also clashed over funding for 16 to 19 year olds in this exchange, which happened at Prime Minister’s Questions. We’re looking into this separately and will be publishing a factcheck on it shortly. Funding for adult skills fell by about 40% The way in which adult skills have been funded has changed over the past five or so years.   Previously funding was split into classroom-based provision—known as the ‘adult learner responsive’ budget—and employer-based provision—known as the ‘employer responsive’ budget. These were brought together into a single Adult Skills Budget from 2011/12. Combining the classroom-based funding with the employer-based funding, and including apprenticeships for people aged 19 and over, spending was about £3.1 billion in 2009/10. That fell to around £2 billion in the Adult Skills Budget provision for 2015/16, or around £1.8 billion in 2009/10 prices.  The 41% fall includes a 14% decline in 2015/16. Funding for adult skills outside of apprenticeships was hit particularly hard in that year. Some programmes were cut from the budget over this period. For example, the government announced in 2010 that it was abolishing the Train to Gain programme in order to “significantly lower the overall cost of the further education system”. The programme supported employers to improve the skills of their employees. Some of the budget for this programme was diverted to adult apprenticeships in 2010/11.  Overall funding on adult skills is expected to increase over this Parliament The Adult Skills Budget has now become the ‘Adult Education Budget’, which incorporates the Adult Skills Budget along with other post-18 skills budgets, but doesn’t pay for apprenticeships. That Adult Education Budget is being protected in cash terms over the current Parliament. That won’t protect it from inflation. Other funding will increase. The adult apprenticeships budget is expected to see an above inflation increase, rising from around £770 million in 2015/16 to £1.5 billion in 2019/20.   The government is also extending the loans system for students in further education.   The government says that in combination, its plans mean an above-inflation increase in funding for adult skills over this Parliament.","Analysis by membership body the Association of Colleges has shown that spending on core adult skills for those aged 19 and over fell by 35% between 2009/10 and 2015/16. The cut was about 41% once inflation is accounted for.

305,fullfact,"There has been a 10% funding cut in real terms in sixth form and further education. 
","“We are introducing in our country a situation where we uncap university places so as many people who want to go can go, and that we will be introducing, in this Parliament, 3 million apprentices. That, combined with better funded sixth forms and better funded further education colleges, means that we have actually got a proper education system that can really drive opportunity in our country.” David Cameron, 9 March 2016 “Could I kindly bring him back to the question I asked from Callum, and point out to him that there has been a 10% cut in real terms in sixth form and further education... during his time as Prime Minister?” Jeremy Corbyn, 9 March 2016 The government told us when the Prime Minister talked about “better funded” sixth forms and colleges he was, partly, talking about changes in the way that sixth forms and further education colleges are funded, which it says has led to “fairer” funding. Historically sixth forms in schools were paid more per student than sixth form colleges and further education colleges. Changes brought about in the last Parliament reduced funding per student for school sixth forms to be in line with the rest of the post-16 sector, through a new national funding rate. The government also pointed to its commitment to protect education funding for each 16 to 18 year old at the same level over this Parliament. This protection is in cash terms. So while the level of funding per student will stay the same, the value of that money will decline due to inflation. As Mr Corbyn said, funding for sixth forms and colleges has fallen by 10% while David Cameron has been Prime Minister, after inflation has been taken into account. That covers the period from 2010/11 to 2014/15, and comes from calculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). School sixth forms, sixth form colleges and further education colleges now have the same funding rate The government said in 2010 that school sixth forms were funded on average £280 more per student than general further education colleges and sixth form colleges. This didn’t take account of the size of the programmes of study. The government said that because students in school sixth forms took the equivalent of more qualifications on average, they got more funding per student. To end this gap, the government pledged to bring funding for school sixth forms in line with funding for further education colleges and school sixth forms. This meant that school sixth forms saw their funding reduced. They were offered transitional protection up to 2015, as the change was brought in.  A new national funding formula was introduced in 2013/14, which shifted funding from being paid per qualification to being paid per student. Previously, the per qualification funding meant that a young person undertaking a large number of small qualifications would attract high levels of funding for the provider. The government said that the new system removed the incentive for providers ""to enter students for easier qualifications"". Institutions with large vocational programmes or offering the International Baccalaureate, for example, were particularly affected because those accounted for multiple qualifications. The government said that no institution would see its funding per student fall for at least three years.  Funding per student will fall, once inflation is taken into account Last autumn, the government announced that the funding that English sixth forms and further education colleges get per student will be protected in cash terms over this Parliament. That means that the base funding for full-time students aged between 16 and 17 will stay at £4,000 per student, and at £3,300 for 18 year olds. The lower rate for 18 year olds was introduced towards the end of the last Parliament in order to reduce spending in the 16 to 19 education budget. That policy was thought to affect further education colleges in particular.  But the protection doesn’t account for inflation, so the real terms value of this particular funding will fall. The Education Funding Agency, which manages funding given to sixth forms and colleges for 16 to 19 year old students, has said that there will also be reductions to non-core funding. It said by 2019/2020 this funding would be reduced by around £160 million. In tandem with this, the transitional protection funding is still in place but is being phased out over the next six years. The total effect of these changes is unclear. It will depend in part on what happens to student numbers. Sector membership body the Association of Colleges said in response to these announcements that overall funding is “largely static”.  Funding for sixth forms and colleges fell by 10% in the last Parliament Funding allocated to further education colleges and schools’ sixth forms for 16 to 19 year olds fell by 10% between 2010/11 and 2014/15, accounting for inflation, according to the IFS. The National Audit Office said in a report in 2015 that the financial health of the further education sector—excluding sixth forms—had been declining since 2010/11. It said that “Reductions and changing priorities in public funding, falling numbers of 16‑ to 18-year-olds, and more competition from schools and universities have combined to create a challenging educational and financial climate for many colleges”.","That’s correct. Spending for 16-19 year olds in sixth forms and colleges fell by 10% between 2010/11 and 2014/15, after accounting for inflation, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

So while the level of funding per student will stay the same, the value of that money will decline due to inflation. As Mr Corbyn said, funding for sixth forms and colleges has fallen by 10% while David Cameron has been Prime Minister, after inflation has been taken into account. That covers the period from 2010/11 to 2014/15, and comes from calculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). School sixth forms, sixth form colleges and further education colleges now have the same funding rate The government said in 2010 that school sixth forms were funded on average £280 more per student than general further education colleges and sixth form colleges. This didn’t take account of the size of the programmes of study. The government said that because students in school sixth forms took the equivalent of more qualifications on average, they got more funding per student. To end this gap, the government pledged to bring funding for school sixth forms in line with funding for further education colleges and school sixth forms. This meant that school sixth forms saw their funding reduced. They were offered transitional protection up to 2015, as the change was brought in.  A new national funding formula was introduced in 2013/14, which shifted funding from being paid per qualification to being paid per student. Previously, the per qualification funding meant that a young person undertaking a large number of small qualifications would attract high levels of funding for the provider. The government said that the new system removed the incentive for providers ""to enter students for easier qualifications"". Institutions with large vocational programmes or offering the International Baccalaureate, for example, were particularly affected because those accounted for multiple qualifications. The government said that no institution would see its funding per student fall for at least three years.  Funding per student will fall, once inflation is taken into account Last autumn, the government announced that the funding that English sixth forms and further education colleges get per student will be protected in cash terms over this Parliament. That means that the base funding for full-time students aged between 16 and 17 will stay at £4,000 per student, and at £3,300 for 18 year olds. The lower rate for 18 year olds was introduced towards the end of the last Parliament in order to reduce spending in the 16 to 19 education budget. That policy was thought to affect further education colleges in particular.  But the protection doesn’t account for inflation, so the real terms value of this particular funding will fall. The Education Funding Agency, which manages funding given to sixth forms and colleges for 16 to 19 year old students, has said that there will also be reductions to non-core funding. It said by 2019/2020 this funding would be reduced by around £160 million. In tandem with this, the transitional protection funding is still in place but is being phased out over the next six years. The total effect of these changes is unclear. It will depend in part on what happens to student numbers. Sector membership body the Association of Colleges said in response to these announcements that overall funding is “largely static”.  Funding for sixth forms and colleges fell by 10% in the last Parliament Funding allocated to further education colleges and schools’ sixth forms for 16 to 19 year olds fell by 10% between 2010/11 and 2014/15, accounting for inflation, according to the IFS. The National Audit Office said in a report in 2015 that the financial health of the further education sector—excluding sixth forms—had been declining since 2010/11. It said that “Reductions and changing priorities in public funding, falling numbers of 16‑ to 18-year-olds, and more competition from schools and universities have combined to create a challenging educational and financial climate for many colleges”.","
 
It depends how you interpret “better”.

306,fullfact,"The Conservatives have overseen the deepest cuts to post-16 education ever. 
","""The Tories have totally failed to address the big challenges facing education […] the deepest, most severe cuts to post-16 education that we'll have ever seen."" Lucy Powell, Shadow Education Secretary, 30 September 2015 Funding for the 16-19 education budget in England fell by nearly 14% over the last Parliament after adjusting for inflation, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That's 4% a year.  This contrasts with an increase of almost 8% a year on average between 1998 and 2009. The IFS hasn't compared prior to this because it said there is no consistent set of figures available. The Conservatives have pledged to protect school funding over this Parliament, but not specified what will happen to funding for post-16 education. The IFS says that if cuts continue at the same rate, the 16-19 education budget will have fallen by 28% between 2010/11 and 2019/20 (after inflation). Real-terms cut in funding to colleges and sixth forms 16-19 education here includes further education, sixth forms, apprenticeships and bursary support (the 16-19 bursary and its predecessor, Education Maintenance Allowance). That's the main area of spending typically described as 'post-16 education'. We haven't looked at funding for adult education here. The 14% cut to 16-19 education over the last Parliament compares with a 39% rise in the early years budget, and a 3% rise in the schools budget (for pupils aged 5-16). Expenditure on apprenticeships, within the 16-19 budget, fell by 3% in real terms. The cuts were partly driven by the lower budget of the new 16-19 bursary scheme compared with the old EMA, the IFS has said. But it also commented that funding allocated to colleges and sixth forms had also been cut by 10% in real terms. Meanwhile the number of 16 to 18 year olds in education and training grew by about 1.5% between 2010 and 2014 (at the same time as the increase in the compulsory education or training age to 18). The way in which 16-education is funded also changed in 2013/14, when funding became awarded 'per student' rather than 'per qualification'. Previously, the per qualification funding meant that a young person undertaking a large number of small qualifications could attract high levels of funding for the provider. We don't know what will happen to post-16 funding in this government As the Conservatives have only pledged to protect education spending on schools, we don't know what will happen to post-16 funding. The government has said decisions on expenditure beyond 2015/16 will be made as part of the spending plans being published in November. The government has also announced a review of post-16 education and training providers, which seeks to address ""the significant financial pressures on institutions"".","Last Parliament saw spending on 16-19 education fall by 4% a year (after inflation). This contrasts with an increase of 8% a year on average between 1998 and 2009, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (we don't have comparable data before then).

The schools budget has been increased over the past few years. 
","“[Nicky Morgan] wrote me a letter just on Saturday saying that the school budget is going to be protected in real terms—which isn’t true. The Institute of Fiscal Studies says 8% cut.” Kevin Courtney, Acting General Secretary, National Union of Teachers, 5 July 2016 “I’m afraid I just don’t recognise that picture. The schools budget is the highest it’s ever been this year at £40 billion. It has gone up by £4 billion since 2011/12”. Nicky Morgan, Secretary of State for Education, 5 July 2016 There are a lot of possible ways to describe government spending on schools.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies does predict an 8% cut in school spending Mr Courtney, representing the teachers out on strike today, invoked the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The IFS has said that “school spending per pupil is likely to fall by around 8% in real terms (based on a school specific measure of inflation) between 2014–15 and 2019–20”. There are three parts to this prediction: the actual cash spent; the real value of that money after inflation; and the number of pupils that money goes on. The IFS is looking at all three in combination: spending, adjusted for inflation, per pupil. By contrast, the Conservative manifesto committed to protect spending against rising pupil numbers, but not against rising prices.

Or you could say that £100 won’t go as far in 2020 because of inflation, so it’s more like £95 in today’s money. And either way, you could say that you need to divide by the number of people in the round to see how far the money goes. The size of the budget Saying that the headline schools budget is “the highest it’s ever been” ignores the effect of inflation—budgets generally have to keep increasing just to maintain their real value. So while it’s correct that the core schools budget was £40 billion in 2015/16, up from £36.5 billion in 2011/12, that doesn’t necessarily tells us very much about education funding. But the IFS can. It shows that real terms spending per pupil has generally risen since the late 1970s, by around 2% per year in the 1980s and 1990s and 5% per year in the 2000s. There was also a small increase under the last government.

345,fullfact,"The National Audit Office said that schools face real term cuts of 8% by 2019/20.
","“A report by the National Audit Office has said schools face cuts of 8% in real terms by 2019/20.” Guardian, 17 January 2017 Overall government spending on English schools is set to increase by 2019/20, but increasing costs from things like staffing and pensions, means that schools will have to spend less per pupil in order to keep in line with budgets. In other words, schools will be given more money from the government, but their costs are set to grow by even more. The National Audit Office (NAO) has said that per pupil spending in mainstream schools will need to decrease by 8% between 2014/15 and 2019/20, after inflation, to account for these extra costs. Spending on mainstream schools is set to increase from just under £35 billion in 2015/16 to around £38 billion in 2019/20. But there are a number of “pressures” that schools will have to deal with during this time which the NAO have identified. These include rising pupil numbers and increasing costs from staff wages and pension schemes. Because of these pressures the Department for Education has estimated the savings schools will need to make in other parts of their budgets. By 2019/20 schools will need to save £3 billion. About 57% of that is expected to come from staffing costs. It is these changes that amount to an 8% reduction in spending per pupil, something that the Institute for Fiscal Studies has also said and we’ve written about before. The NAO also says it doesn’t know if these spending reductions “will be achieved in practice”. Schools have money allocated to them by their local council largely based on the number of pupils and the deprivation in the area. It can also use other factors to decide how much to allocate like how well the school has performed in the past or how many children in care attend the school. The money councils have to give to schools in their area is determined by the government and based on how much money the council has received per pupil in previous years. This means that there’s no national set of rules for how spending is allocated to pupils across the whole country which the government says is “unfair, untransparent and out of date”. It plans to introduce new funding rules for schools in 2018/19 which will make schools’ budgets more certain each year but according to the NAO could mean “budgets of schools which currently have high levels of funding being reduced, and more poorly funded schools having their budgets increased”. Spending on schools, in real terms, increased by 3% overall and 0.6% per pupil between 2010/11 and 2014/15, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It said that spending on schools was “relatively protected”. Across all public services spending fell by 8% over the same period. This relative protection will continue, according to the IFS: it expects some government departments to have to reduce their spending by over a quarter by 2019/20. The National Audit Office’s findings apply to “mainstream schools”, which are all government funded schools excluding special schools and alternative provision schools. There were 20,179 of these state-funded primary and secondary schools in England in January 2016. These schools taught 7.8 million children and just over 6.4 million were between the age of five and 15. Spending on pupils older than the age of 15 comes from a separate pot of money.","The National Audit Office said that although overall spending on schools will increase between 2014/15 and 2019/20, increasing pupil numbers and staff costs mean they will need to spend 8% less per pupil.

307,fullfact,"There's no evidence of a big drop-off rate of apprenticeships.
","""There is no point in having starts if they are not going to be completed, but there is no evidence that there is a big drop?off rate of apprenticeships. If there was evidence of that, there would be a concern about looking at completions as well as starts."" Sajid Javid, Business Secretary, 14 October 2015 Just under a third (31%) of apprenticeships finishing or due to finish in England in 2013/14 weren't successfully completed—a proportion that has increased over the last few years, from 26% in 2011/12. That counts the rate of people failing to meet all the requirements for their apprenticeship in the year they ended or were due to end it. Looking just at the number of apprenticeships completed each year, that's been about the same over the last few years. The business secretary's comments came in response to a question about the number of completions, so it's possible he meant there's no evidence completions have been falling. But the proportion of people being unsuccessful in completing their apprenticeship seems a better indication of the ""drop-off rate"". We put this point to the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills, which only commented that overall trends would be visible from January 2016, when the success rates for 2014/15 will be published. About a third of apprenticeships are not successfully completed 69% of learners successfully completed the requirements of their apprenticeship (their ""apprenticeship framework""), out of those finishing in 2013/14.  So the remainder are those who failed to complete the framework (i.e. dropped out or failed to achieve all requirements) and who have left training. There are a few circumstances where people won't have been counted in these statistics, such as where they dropped out before their funding kicked in, transferred to another programme, or took a planned temporary break from learning. Number of apprenticeships completed has ""remained strong"" Staying around the 250,000-260,000 mark between 2011/12 and 2013/14, the number of apprenticeship completions—or ""achievements"" as the statisticians call them—hasn't changed much. The statistical release comments that completions ""have remained strong"". The provisional figures for 2014/15 suggest a slight fall, but we won't know the real trend until the final figures are published (which tend to revise the provisional figures upward).  For information on apprenticeship starts, and more detail on trends in apprenticeships, see our briefing.","While the number of apprenticeships achieved each year has remained consistent, looking at achievements as a proportion of those finishing or due to finish shows,  just under a third were unsuccessful - a proportion which has been increasing.

235,fullfact,"New rules mean that men accused of rape must prove that the woman consented to sex.
","""Men must prove a woman said Yes under tough new rape rules"" Daily Telegraph, 29 January 2015 New advice for prosecutors has been published by the Crown Prosecution Service, aimed at improving how rape cases are handled. It does not in any way change the law on rape, which says that prosecutors have to prove that the alleged victim (of either gender) didn't consent to sex. Someone accused of rape doesn't have to ""prove"" anything—despite today's headline in the Telegraph. This is because in English law, it's generally for the prosecution to show that a defendant is guilty for them to be convicted of a criminal offence. This is referred to as the 'burden of proof'. In rape cases, to get a conviction the prosecution has to prove three things: Consent means that a person ""agrees by choice, and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice"". The Crown Prosecution Service's existing Legal Guidance says that it's important for the police to ask during their investigations about the steps the defendant took to establish that consent existed. But this doesn't mean that if he didn't take active steps he is guilty of rape. It's to help gather evidence so that the prosecution can try to show lack of consent, and lack of reasonable belief that there was consent. The 'toolkits' for police and prosecutors, announced yesterday, don't change the law or the Legal Guidance. But the advice about consent goes further in spelling out the importance of finding evidence about both the fact and the perception of consent. Better evidence would make it more likely that guilty people are convicted—but the dynamics of the trial don't change. Such guidelines might also be aimed at changing behaviour among the public at large, by reiterating that men should seek out consent in sexual encounters. The Director of Public Prosecutions points out that ""many rape victims freeze rather than fight as a protective and coping mechanism"", so absence of a firm ""No"" doesn't mean consent.

","""A man accused of stealing a crate of Lucozade while riding a 'hoverboard' may make British legal history…. Omaree Lindsay, 19, from Croydon, Surrey, is believed to be the first named individual to be prosecuted under new laws that ban the use of the motorised devices on roads and pavements… The Crown Prosecution Service introduced laws banning self-balancing scooters, including hoverboards and single-wheeled 'monopods' in October"" Press Association, 13 December 2015 Public prosecutors have staged an audacious coup d'état, overturning centuries of constitutional government, if a news agency report is to be believed. The Press Association claims that the Crown Prosecution Service recently ""introduced laws"" banning gadgets like 'hoverboards' (self-balancing scooters). The prosecution service has no power to pass laws. It helps to enforce them, by taking criminal cases to court. It's been illegal to use a hoverboard on the path for some time The Press Association story, which appears on the front page of the Daily Telegraph, says that a Croydon man is being prosecuted for driving a self-balancing scooter, or 'hoverboard', on the pavement.  This is illegal in England and Wales because of the Highway Act, dating from 1835. It bans ""riding"" on the path. You might argue that a law passed 180 years ago couldn't very well make it illegal to use a hoverboard on the path. But the law develops. Judges decided in 1879 that it's illegal to ride a bicycle on the path under the same 1835 Act, even if they were ""unknown at the time when the Act passed"". And we found a case from 2011 in which the High Court confirmed that the venerable law also applies to riding a Segway—a similar type of self-balancing scooter. Lord Justice Munby said that ""the fact that Parliament in 1835 could not have had the Segway in mind is true but irrelevant"". Recently the police have drawn attention to the law on hoverboards The claim that the recent prosecution is down to ""new laws"" seems to be because of a tweet.  In October 2015, this warning from the Metropolitan Police was widely reported. The link is to guidance on the prosecution service website, although it's labelled as ""from the Department for Transport"". The guidance says that it's illegal to ride a self-balancing scooter like a Segway or hoverboard on a public path or on the road. This statement of what the law says isn't new either. It had been issued by the time of the High Court case in 2011, as it's mentioned in the judgment. And a transport minister said the same thing in the House of Lords in 2009. Clearly, though, word hadn't gotten around until the police took to Twitter. Having a law and enforcing it are different things The Sunday Times reported yesterday that from responses to Freedom of Information requests to police forces, it could only identify one arrest for riding a self-balancing scooter. It doesn't specify whether this was a hoverboard. It's important to be clear that even if police and prosecutors don't seem to apply the law very often, they don't get to decide what it is. Neither does the Department for Transport. To quote Lord Justice Munby again: ""The law is made by Parliament… The law is declared by the judges."" Parliament, or a higher court, could in future reverse his decision that self-balancing scooters are caught by the 1835 Act. The prosecution service would have to act accordingly. But for now, hoverboard riders beware.","This is illegal, but not because prosecutors say so. The law making it illegal to ride on the path dates from 1835, and judges confirmed in 2011 that it applies to devices like hoverboards.

137,fullfact,"The EU Court of Justice has decided that obese people are disabled, and so entitled to protection under employment law. 
","""Fury as Euro court rules the obese are disabled"" Daily Express, 19 December 2014 A decision concerning a childminder who claims he was sacked for being overweight was published yesterday by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Most of the media have reported that the outcome means that obesity ""can"" be a disability, rather than that it ""is"". What's the difference, and does it matter? In 2010, Karsten Kaltoft was dismissed from his job by a Danish local authority, and a union took a case on his behalf alleging that he had been singled out on the basis of his obesity. EU law protects employees from being treated less favourably on various grounds, such as age, disability and sexual orientation. The District Court hearing the case wasn't sure whether an obese person can qualify for the protection of this law, so it asked the EU Court of Justice for a 'preliminary ruling' to decide. This isn't the same as deciding whether Mr. Kaltoft was actually discriminated against, which is still a matter for the Danish court.  The Court of Justice said that EU law does not state ""a general principle of non-discrimination on grounds of obesity as such"". But the Danish court had asked another question: basically, ""can obesity be deemed to be a disability?"" This was asked because being disabled (and so protected from discrimination) isn't defined as having one of a list of conditions. It usually depends on the circumstances of each individual. The court said that obesity itself isn't a disability, because it doesn't necessarily ""entail the existence of a limitation"" on someone's contribution in the workplace. But if it does, in a particular person's case, give rise to a limitation on their ability to work or find employment, then a court should protect that person from discrimination. So when the case plays out in the Danish District Court, they can decide that Mr. Kaltoft's obesity makes him disabled if they think it has that kind of impact—but they don't have to treat him as disabled just because he's obese. It's the effect of obesity that matters, not the fact of it. So most of the press are correct in reporting the outcome, in the context of employment law, being that obesity can lead to disability, rather than is a disability. The upshot of this judgment is a little unclear for now. English law already said that when it comes to obesity, the effect rather than the label is what matters. Some lawyers think this case expands the notion of a disability a little, from medical conditions associated with obesity to other features of it like inability to move or breathe easily. That might make it tricky for employers to work out when such difficulties are severe enough to trigger their responsibility to make reasonable adjustments in the workplace. But it's hardly a massive change—whereas a decision that being severely obese automatically makes someone disabled certainly would have been. Since the judgment is about employment law, it has no impact on access to disability benefits, or the Blue Badge scheme, or anything else disabled people are entitled to outside the workplace. Update 20 December 2014 The Daily Mail originally opened its story by stating ""Obesity is a disability, Europe's highest court has today ruled"". This has since been corrected, but the online headline remains ""Obesity IS a disability, rules highest EU court..."". ","Not correct. The court said that an obese person can be considered disabled, if their ability to work is limited. In itself this isn't a major change.

203,fullfact,"Obesity costs the economy £27 billion a year.
","“Obesity drives disease. It increases the risk of cancer, diabetes and heart disease—and it costs our economy £27 billion a year.” George Osborne, 16 March 2016 Announcing a tax on sugary drinks companies yesterday the Chancellor said it would help to prevent obesity, which he said costs the economy £27 billion a year. £27 billion may be the best estimate we’ve got for the total costs to the NHS and the economy of people considered to be overweight and obese in England, but there are issues with it. We don’t know enough to be as precise as saying the cost is £27 billion. Some of the research underpinning the figure is over a decade old. Patterns of obesity may have changed since then, and the economy definitely has. It also relied on some assumptions that were uncertain at the time. Some of the analysis could seem a bit counter-intuitive. The ‘total cost’ combines the cost to the NHS budget for treating people with obesity-related problems with the reduction in UK economic growth because they miss work. Where the figure comes from The government takes its estimate of £27 billion from the National Obesity Observatory, now part of Public Health England. This took the figure from 2007 research, which in turn based its calculations in part on 2004 research by Parliament’s Health Committee. The 2004 research put the total cost of people considered obese at between £3.3 billion and 3.7 billion in 2002. That was made up of the cost of treating obesity and its consequences—about £1 billion—and the earnings lost due to sickness and premature mortality among obese people. It said that “if in crude terms” the cost of people considered overweight was half that of people considered obese, and given that there are about twice as many people who are overweight as obese, the total costs of both overweight and obese people would be about £6.6-7.4 billion a year. So about £7 billion. So the research found the total costs of people being overweight or obese (£7 billion) were seven times the costs of treating obese patients (£1 billion). The more recent estimate from 2007 is based on the assumption that the total costs of people considered to be overweight or obese continue to be seven times the cost of NHS treatment. It estimated that the cost of treating obesity alone would be £3.9 billion by 2015, based on projections of the population’s body mass index profile, the effect this would have on diseases in the population, and the cost to the NHS of treating these diseases. It multiplied this £3.9 billion by seven to reach the estimate that the total cost would be £27 billion by 2015. A reader pointed out to us that the estimate didn’t consider any net savings to the NHS budget if people die from obesity-related illnesses, rather than other diseases. A lot can change in a decade Changes in diet since these estimates were made could have affected the number of overweight people, which in turn could have increased or reduced the costs to the NHS and to the economy. The cost of NHS care could have deviated from the forecast for other reasons—for example if drugs costs went up faster than expected. Similarly, it’s not clear that total costs were or will always be seven times the cost to the NHS, as they—roughly—were deemed to be in 2002. For instance changes to the labour market and to the benefits system could change the employment rate for people considered to be overweight or obese. That means the overall economic cost could change relative to the treatment costs. As the National Obesity Observatory said of the research: “Whilst modelling is helpful, it necessarily relies on existing patterns of treatment and assumptions about continued patterns of eating and physical activity as well as behavioural and social responses to obesity. It might also be helpful to look at alternative scenarios as part of modelling estimates such as: obesity trends continue; obesity continues to rise by a specified percentage per year; obesity is reduced by a specified percentage per year.” Finally, the £27 billion was in 2007 prices. In today’s prices the cost would be higher. Update 13 December 2016 We updated this piece in response to feedback from a reader. We clarified that the ‘total cost’ given by the original report combined the cost to the NHS budget with the reduction to UK economic growth, and that it didn't include any potential savings to the NHS.","This is the best estimate we’ve got of the total cost of obesity and being overweight to the NHS and the economy. But it’s based on analysis that’s over a decade old and there’s a lot of uncertainty to the numbers.

158,fullfact,"The UK dropping our EU treaty commitment to ""ever closer union"" would make us less likely to be drawn into a federal Europe. 
"," ""We want an end to our commitment to an 'ever closer union,' as enshrined in the Treaty to which every EU country has to sign up."" Conservative party manifesto 2015 ""If 'ever closer union' were abandoned as an objective, the consequences would be serious."" Roger Bootle, City A.M., 4 June 2015 ""People in Britain … do not want to be part of an ever-closer union to be dragged into a state called Europe. That may be for others, but it will never be for Britain, and it is time to recognise that specifically."" David Cameron, 26 June 2015 Two hundred years after a future British Prime Minister went to Brussels to settle the political direction of Europe, David Cameron was in the same city to formally present his aims for renegotiated EU membership. His plan relies on more words and fewer bayonets than Waterloo. Three words in particular, from the EU treaties, are said to be important: ""ever closer union"". But are they significant? Put another way, would disapplying them from the UK—as Mr Cameron says he wants to do—really make much difference? Not an opt-out from any particular laws The changes Mr Cameron is seeking on ever closer union are sometimes referred to as an opt-out. This is a little unfortunate, as it implies that some EU laws will not apply to the UK as a result of this action. That isn't the case. The EU is allowed to pass laws only on subjects that the treaties, as interpreted by the EU court, allow it to. For instance, the law on fair competition between companies is an EU area because it says so in the treaties signed by all the members. Competition law is an exclusive EU 'competence'. An 'opt-out' usually refers to a situation where an EU competence doesn't extend to a particular country. That, too, is only because an exception is written into the treaties (after negotiation). The UK has got an opt-out on laws passed under the EU competence in 'freedom, justice and security'. This includes things like criminal justice and asylum—which is why we wouldn't have had to take a quota of refugees if that idea had come to pass. The three references to ""ever closer union"" in the treaties don't create any particular competence; nor do they mean that the EU has to keep expanding its powers over time, or can't be stripped of them. It's not a case of opting out from this concept in order to escape the reach of future laws created under it. Some impact in the courts It has been argued, though, that the phrase matters in the EU court. The idea is that when the judges come to make decisions on the EU's centralised power under the treaties, the reference to ""ever closer union""  helps them justify conclusions that expand that power. The House of Commons Library looked into this recently, and pointed out that this rarely happens directly. The EU court has only ever cited the phrase ""ever closer union"" 54 times, and even fewer of those are final judgments (some appearances are in preliminary, though influential, opinions by an Advocate-General). Even when it does appear, the judges are sometimes focused on the full phrase ""ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen"", in the context of public access to official documents. The academic Gunnar Beck has argued that while the phrase itself is rare, the court has hundreds of times referred to the ""spirit"" of the treaties or individual laws, which he says amounts to ""ever closer union"". That sense of an over-riding objective gives the court a tendency to ""favour or enhance further European integration"" in its decisions. A matter of politics and symbolism If that's true, removing this phrase from the treaties, or stating that it can't be invoked in cases involving the UK, could send a message to the court—and the other EU institutions—that leads to changes in behaviour. Then again, the treaties have plenty more general rhetoric where that came from. They talk about ""a new stage in the process of European integration""; ""further steps to be taken in order to advance European integration""; of ""solidarity"" and ""convergence"". The court, Commission and other EU bodies could take the view that the spirit of European integration isn't necessarily confined to one phrase. Mr Cameron, though, may agree with people like Roger Bootle that a sense of inexorable political momentum towards a more centralised EU is created by the particular phrase ""ever closer union"". It may, on its own, be largely symbolic, but that's not the same as unimportant. Whether or not a treaty reference to ""ever closer union"" gives European politicians a mandate, mission or tendency to pursue integration further than they otherwise would is impossible for us to say. What we can be quite sure of is that removing it isn't going to give rise to immediate, concrete change in how the EU or the UK work. The Prime Minister is playing for less tangible stakes, over a longer term.","Unlike opt-outs in specific areas of EU activity, this change wouldn't have a direct legal effect. Any impact would be mainly political.

138,fullfact,"The EU has ordered organic farmers to treat sick animals with homeopathy in a new directive. 
","  ""EU orders Britain's organic farmers to treat sick animals with homeopathy""—Daily Telegraph, 24 April 2015 For better or worse, homeopathic remedies are certainly promoted in EU organic food standards. But they're not the only alternative to ordinary medicine, and organic farmers are allowed to call in the vet if 'natural' methods don't work. The Telegraph originally reported of a ""new EU directive which came into force in January"", and quoted from it. We initially said that we couldn't find any evidence that this specific directive or quote existed. That's still true of the quote, which no longer appears in the article online. This revised version also expands on the reference to January: although most EU legislation on this is old, as we explain below, one measure relating to organic certification for fish didn't apply here until this year. We didn't pick up on this in our original analysis. Organic farming rules The EU says that its laws in this area are about ""consumer confidence in products labelled as organic"". The main EU regulation dealing with organic farming was made in 2007. It says that sick animals can be treated with ordinary medicine, including antibiotics, when the use of more natural remedies is ""inappropriate"". More detailed rules from 2008 list products that should be preferred to medicine and antibiotics ""provided that their therapeutic effect is effective"". These include homeopathic products, but also various vitamins and compounds of mineral origin. If they don't work, and treatment is needed to prevent the animal from suffering, a vet should be called in. So the law is quite clear: these approaches should be used in organic farming so long as they work. Animals that receive more than a certain amount of ordinary medicine can't then be called 'organic', though. The Telegraph has previously reported the government's Chief Scientific Advisor as saying that ""homoeopathy is nonsense"". Reacting to the law, not the story The rules are reflected in the responses of those quoted in the Telegraph's article. The Department for Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said, correctly, that farmers ""could resort to other means, such as antibiotics, without losing their 'organic' status if homeopathic remedies proved to be ineffective"". A spokesperson for the Norwegian Veterinary Association is quoted as saying that ""If you start using homeopathy, you prolong the time when the animals are not getting adequate treatment and that's a threat to animal welfare"". That's perfectly consistent with a situation where homeopathy is among the remedies encouraged, with medical treatment as a fall-back when the animal remains sick. The evolution of a myth Hold on. If this has been the case for years, why is it a story now, and why are there Norwegians involved? Let's look at the timeline. The Telegraph story was published on the evening of 24 April. On the 23rd, the Daily Mail had published a story on the organic rules as they relate to fish (as opposed to livestock), which date from 2009.      The Daily Mail, in turn, cites a Norwegian English-language website, The Local, which ran its story earlier the same day. It makes clear that the issue has come up because Norway, which has to take on board a lot of EU laws despite not being a member, is only now getting around to implementing the rules on organic fish. Its vets aren't happy about the homeopathy element. The Local references the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet, which in its report on 22 April links through to those 2009 rules on organic aquaculture. Dagbladet confirms that they ""are not new"" (as per Google Translate). A January 2015 directive? The Telegraph was specific in its reporting, though. It mentioned a ""directive"" coming into force in January, and included an extract from it. There's no indication in the EU law database that any significant changes to the law went through recently. The EU Official Journal list of new laws in January is heavy on imported fruit and vegetables, but light on new organic regulation. The organic umbrella group IFOAM EU has a list of EU laws on organic farming on its website, going into 2015. None of them correspond to what the Telegraph first reported, so we originally said this seemed like an error on their part. The Telegraph has since pointed out that the 2009 rules on aquaculture came with a transitional period, to July 2013. They were then extended to 1 January 2015. This is made clear in the revised article, which also describes ""rules from Brussels"" rather than ""new rules from Brussels"". The newspaper says that Defra provided the wrong information on when the law was changed. The specific quote The Telegraph quoted from the ""new directive"" as follows: ""it is a general requirement for production of all organic livestock that (herbal) and homeopathic products shall be used in preference to chemically-synthesised allopathic veterinary treatment or antibiotics."" The underlined part comes from the 2008 rules: ""Phytotherapeutic, homoepathic products, trace elements and [vitamins and minerals] shall be used in preference to chemically-synthesized allopathic veterinary treatment or antibiotics, provided that their therapeutic effect is effective for the species of animal, and the condition for which the treatment is intended."" We can't locate any document that contains the first half of the quotation, which has since been removed from the article. The Telegraph explained that it came from Defra, and could reflect an earlier draft of the legislation. As the Telegraph doesn't run a corrections column or tag online articles when they're revised, we don't know when these changes were made.","EU legislation promotes homeopathy in organic farming if it's an effective treatment. The law isn't particularly new, as a revised version of the claim makes clear.

159,fullfact,"Roaming charges in Europe are lower because of the EU.
","""Europe makes us better off. Being in means... lower phone roaming charges when travelling. Will Straw, Britain Stronger in Europe, 11 March 2016 Claims about the EU's role in cutting the cost of using a mobile phone abroad are frequent to the point of notoriety. There's good reason for this: the maximum that networks can charge for calls, text and data in another EU country has been capped for years now, and at lower and lower levels. By 2017, companies won't be able to routinely charge any extra for roaming. Various EU regulations have placed limits on what providers can charge for making and receiving calls, sending text messages and using mobile data in the EU.      Data collected by national regulators and published by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) shows the average retail price per minute for making roaming calls has fallen by 79% from before the introduction of the cap to last year. The price for receiving calls abroad is down by 89%, the price of a text message by 79%, and data per megabyte by 95%. Some of this may be down to factors other than the cap: the retail price for roaming data had been decreasing before the cap was introduced in 2012. This is just the rate charged for roaming specifically, so it doesn't take into account any price rises in regular bills that providers may have introduced to make up for lost roaming income. Roaming charges to be scrapped altogether within a couple of years Anecdotal evidence indicates that some people still pay a lot to use their phones abroad under the capped regime. A law to scrap roaming charges altogether from June 2017 was passed in 2015. When it comes fully into force, networks won't be able to charge a customer more for roaming within the EU than they charge at home. Between April 2016 and June 2017, they'll be able to add a top-up fee of no more than €0.05 on every call made or megabyte of data used, and €0.02 on every SMS sent (excluding VAT). These fees will be abolished altogether from 15 June 2017. Higher rates will be possible only under a 'fair use' exception to make sure the rules only apply to ""periodic travel"". The EU says it would be ""abusive"" if people were able to sign up to a provider in a country where it's cheap, and make that their permanent mobile phone plan back in their home country. But even the 'fair use' rates are set to be capped at the current maximum. On the face of it that seems to mean that, for example, someone with a Spanish mobile phone contract could take their device to the UK permanently and be guaranteed to pay no more than the 2014 rates shown in our chart above. The Commission is due to publish detailed 'fair use' rules by the end of the year, though, so it may not work like that. Update 16 November 2015 We updated the article to include data on the average retail prices for roaming calls, texts and data published by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC). We also changed references to a draft law to scrap roaming charges, as it has since been passed. Update 2 June 2016 We updated some figures and quoted a more recent claim from Britain Stronger in Europe.","The EU has put a cap on the amount you can be charged for using your phone abroad, and prices have fallen. Networks won't generally be able to charge roaming fees at all from 2017.

181,fullfact,"Mobile roaming fees could return for Brits in the EU after Brexit after Theresa May confirms exit from bloc’s digital market.
","“Mobile roaming fees could return for Brits in the EU after Brexit after Theresa May confirms exit from bloc’s digital market” The Sun, 7 March 2018 Since 2017, if you send a text, make a call, or download data in another EU country, you’re charged the same rate as if you did so at home. That’s because of EU laws prohibiting roaming fees. After Brexit these laws will no longer apply to the UK—but that’s about all we know with any certainty. UK network operators will be able to reintroduce roaming charges if they wish. Some major operators say they currently have no plans to do so, but that could be affected by commercial decisions made by EU and British operators after Brexit. A lot could boil down to whether EU mobile operators choose to increase ‘wholesale’ prices for UK operators. That’s the charge UK mobile operators pay them when their customers use their phones in the EU. Wholesale prices are capped under EU law, but the cap won’t apply after Brexit—and if wholesale prices are raised by EU operators, then UK operators might choose to reintroduce roaming fees to cover the cost. Another possibility is that the government creates its own laws regulating roaming fees. However, a parliamentary committee thinks this would have to take the form of an agreement with the EU, and would be dependent upon the UK and EU agreeing a wider trade deal. In March, Theresa May announced that “the UK will not be part of the EU's Digital Single Market” (DSM) after Brexit. The DSM is not a formal arrangement like the Single Market, rather it’s a series of laws and regulations which the EU has been introducing since 2015. The aim of these laws is to ensure “a free and secure digital single market”, meaning more uniform regulation and access to digital goods (such as films and music bought online) across the EU. The EU’s roaming laws will cease to apply in the UK when we leave, but there are options for staying in the DSM. Some non-EU member countries are covered by the DSM, if they’re members of the European Economic Area (EEA). But EEA members are part of the Single Market—something Theresa May has recently ruled out—so that’s an unlikely scenario for the UK after Brexit. Roam Like at Home, a DSM policy introduced in June 2017, brought an end to roaming charges for EU mobile users in other EU countries. This means that, when you send a text, make a call, or use data in another EU country, you pay the same amount as if you did any of those things at home. There are a few caveats about reasonable use (for instance you could incur charges if you use very large amounts of data, or spend most of your time outside of the UK)—but these are unlikely to affect most people. Roaming charges have previously been perceived as very high. In 2005 the European Commission was informed that roaming “charges are currently very high without clear justification”. It’s possible that UK mobile providers won’t bring back roaming fees, but there will no longer be a law preventing it. What will happen is quite uncertain at the moment, and a lot could depend on the commercial decisions of mobile operators. To understand how mobile operators may react to the situation, it helps to understand how roaming services and charges work within the EU: So after Brexit, UK and EU network operators will be able to raise wholesale prices for each other above the EU price cap. If wholesale prices rise above the present cap, UK mobile providers may want to reintroduce roaming charges in order to cover the cost, according to Ofcom and a government committee. It’s hard to say how likely it is that operators will raise wholesale prices. The government says two operators “have committed publicly to continue surcharge-free roaming in the EU on UK exit”. Three provided us with the following statement from their CEO: “To reassure our customers, we have also committed to maintain the availability of roaming in the EU at no additional cost following Brexit.” Vodafone told us: “It’s too soon to assess the implications of Brexit on roaming regulation, but we expect competition will continue to drive good value for customers. We currently have no plans to change our roaming charges.” EE told us: “EE customers enjoy great value products and controls offering inclusive roaming in Europe and beyond, and we don’t have any plans to change these offers. We are working closely with government on this and hope they will put consumers at the top of their agenda in the Brexit negotiations to help ensure that UK operators can continue to offer low prices to our customers.” An O2 spokesperson told us: “We’re committed to providing our customers with great connectivity and value when they travel overseas. We currently have no plans to change our roaming services across Europe. We’re engaged with the government with regards to what may happen once the UK officially leaves the EU.” A government advisory group on broadband suggests prices could rise unless the government can “secure access for UK operators to wholesale roaming rates”. Another possibility is that the government could impose its own roaming regulations on UK network operators after Brexit. However, a government committee suggests that imposing roaming regulations in British law would require coming to a mutual agreement with the EU. This is because of the “cross-border” technicalities of roaming. Any UK-EU roaming agreement would also have to be part of a wider free trade agreement, as WTO rules mean that a deal cannot be made on roaming policy alone. We don’t as yet know if the UK will reach a trade agreement with the EU for after Brexit, nor whether data roaming will be covered by it. The UK could also include roaming agreements in free trade deals it agrees with any other countries. There is no precedent of a free trade agreement including an agreement on roaming.","Correct. EU regulations mean we can’t currently be charged roaming fees within the EU. After Brexit, we'll no longer be subject to these regulations. It’s unclear if UK mobile companies will bring back roaming charges, nor if a UK-EU roaming regulation agreement can be reached.

160,fullfact,"The UK share of the vote in the EU Council of Ministers is 8%, down from 17% when we joined.
","8%: the UK vote share in the Council, down from 17% in 1973 Vote Leave, 5 January 2016 It's correct that the formal voting weight of the UK in the important EU Council of Ministers has decreased over the years. 8% was right before a recent change in the system that pushes the UK's influence back up to around 13%. While this is the formal position, the EU's culture encourages countries to all agree on decisions. On some issues, the rules require this. Continent united, votes divided Several Leave campaigns paint a picture of declining British influence in the EU institutions that make the big decisions. One of these is what's often known as the Council of Ministers, because it's a committee of government ministers from the different member countries. Along with the European Parliament, it passes most EU law. Up until recently the UK had 29 of the 352 votes on the Council (8%). That share has indeed declined over time, from 10 out of 58 (17%) when we first joined. As more countries joined the EU, the share of the vote held by any one country was diluted. But the Council voting system changed from November 2014. Larger countries like the UK ""are seen as the main beneficiaries of the change"", according to the independent European Parliamentary Research Service. The new system makes population more important. The UK has almost 13% of the EU's population, and now has that share of the vote. The old system can still be used in votes up to the end of March 2017, if a country requests it.    The UK can veto some laws alone, but needs three allies to block others Not all EU decisions affecting the UK can be passed against its wishes. Some important issues can only be decided if every country voting agrees. These areas include foreign affairs, taxation, justice and the EU budget. If the UK is adamantly opposed to a law requiring unanimous approval, it's unlikely to make it as far as a vote. But in other areas, majorities are enough. Under the new system for majority voting, a law has to pass two hurdles. First, 16 out of 28 member states have to vote for it. In special cases, it's 21 out of 28. The UK naturally counts for only 1/28th from this point of view. But there is a second condition: population matters. Member states representing 65% of all the people in the EU have to vote for a law before it passes. The ability of the UK to combine with a couple of other big countries to block a law it doesn't like is made more difficult by a rider to this rule. You can get to 36% against a proposed law from just three countries, but they won't be able to block it unless joined by at least one more. In other words, if fewer than four countries oppose or abstain on a law in the Council, it passes. For example... Let's say the European Commission has proposed a new law on air pollution. When it gets to the Council, Germany, Poland and the UK vote against it, but all other countries are in favour. It has 25 out of 28 votes, passing the first test, but only 64% of the votes by population. It still passes the second test, even though it hasn't hit 65%, because there are only three countries not voting for it. But if another country joins the Nos or abstains, the law then fails. It doesn't matter which country it is, in this scenario—it could be tiny Cyprus or Malta. We recommend playing with the EU's vote calculator to get the hang of how this works. Traditionally, decisions are made without the need for a vote A lot of experts say that voting isn't where the action is when it comes to Council decisions. In a lot of cases—75-80% of the time—every country votes for the proposal on the table. There are a lot of reasons put forward to explain this consensus. It doesn't mean that the vote, or at least the prospect of a vote, isn't important. A lot of work goes on behind the scenes to prepare laws that everyone can support, as there's ultimately no point in pushing something to a vote when many countries oppose it. The UK usually votes with the majority, but is now on the losing side more than any other nation When votes are taken, the UK has recently been on the losing side more often than any other country. It still voted on the winning side nearly 90% of the time over the past six years, according to academics at the London School of Economics. So the UK has to accept some EU decisions that it didn't vote for. Not every decision is equally important. The authors also point out that simply counting votes lost doesn't take into account how strongly British officials feel about them compared to the votes they won.","It has declined, but a new system based on population makes the UK's vote worth 13%. A lot of Council decisions are made by consensus after negotiation, so vote share doesn't neatly capture the UK's influence.

David Cameron, 10 November 2015 Immigration has been named by the Prime Minister as one of the key areas of EU policy in which he will seek reform. His claims about population and immigration are correct. The UK's population is growing. Germany's is shrinking.

In the 'main scenario' put forward, the UK's population grows from 65 million in 2015, to 70 million in 2030 and to 77 million in 2050. By that point, it's expected to be the EU's most populous country. Germany, on the other hand, (the EU's current most populous country) sees its population stay at about 81 million until 2020, then enter into a slow decline, falling to 75 million by 2050.

","""We have seen many more people from the EU coming to Britain than originally anticipated … as a result, our action has not been enough to cut annual net migration to the tens of thousands"" Conservative Party manifesto, 2015 general election ""I want to see immigration come down. That's why we've taken all the steps we have. It hasn't worked so far because of the large numbers coming from inside the EU"" David Cameron, 6 October 2015 The net migration target overall has been consistently unmet. Even with zero net migration from the rest of the EU, this would still have been the case in recent years—with the exception of periods in 2012 and 2013. Hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands: a long-standing goal, unmet This government, like the Coalition before it, has said that it wants to reduce annual net migration—the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and the number leaving in a given year—to tens of thousands a year. This has been variously phrased as an ""ambition"" or a ""target"" over the years. Whatever it's called, it's not been met. The government's own impact assessments as far back as 2011 suggested as much. Net migration was an estimated 327,000 in the year to March 2016, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. It's been higher than 100,000 in every year since 1998. It’s not certain the target is being met even if the estimates fall slightly below 100,000. At the moment, the level of uncertainty in the estimates mean ‘true’ net migration could be tens of thousands higher or lower than the published figures. It would need to fall a lot lower, or remain lower for a prolonged period of time, for us to be more confident the target was being met. The target would be missed even if EU net migration were zero Immigration from the EU has driven most of the recent rise in net migration, and this may well be related to the UK's relatively strong economic performance. But if EU net migration had been zero since the Coalition came to office in 2010, the target would only have been met in parts of 2012 and 2013.  EU net migration is never likely to be zero Net migration from the rest of the EU has been unusually high in recent years. But looking back before that, it was typically been around 80,000 in the years since 2004, and between 6,000 and 30,000 before that. There's still a lot of uncertainty around these estimates, but even reducing EU net migration to the lower levels of recent years would still likely mean the target wouldn't have been hit in 2012 or 2013.  ","Net migration from other EU countries isn't the only reason the government hasn't met its net migration target.

The Home Office set a target to cut immigration down to the tens of thousands.
","“[The Home Office] set the tone which was this, we have to cut immigration down to tens of thousands. They knew they weren’t going to be able to do that, because it was free for people to move about from Europe, so the only way that they could cut back on immigration was [to cut] people who came from outside of Europe."" Emily Thornberry MP, 19 April 2018 It’s correct that governments since 2010 have set a target to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, and this target has never been met. Net migration actually rose to more than three times the target at one point and latest figures for the 12 months to September 2017 estimate it at 244,000.  Net migration is the difference between the number of people immigrating to the UK in a year and the number of people emigrating abroad. In order to meet the target the government would have had to reduce non-EU immigration heavily, because it can’t control the scale of EU (including British) immigration to the UK due to the EU’s rules on free movement. It made some early progress towards this in 2012 and 2013, but the numbers have risen back to roughly 2010 levels again. So even without any EU net migration, the target would only have been met in parts of 2012 and 2013. The government actually looked unlikely to meet the target as early as 2011, when its own impact assessments of its policies suggested reductions to non-EU immigration wouldn’t be enough to meet the target. The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said at the time that “current policies can be expected to deliver about half the reduction in non-EU net migration required to achieve the tens of thousands target by 2015”—though it stressed there was a great deal of uncertainty to all of the estimates.

This is correct, referring to net migration rather than just immigration. Governments since 2010 have continually mentioned this figure, though it’s not clear if it is still in place.

265,fullfact,"The net migration target could only have been met if immigration of non-EU citizens was cut.
","“[The Home Office] set the tone which was this, we have to cut immigration down to tens of thousands. They knew they weren’t going to be able to do that, because it was free for people to move about from Europe, so the only way that they could cut back on immigration was [to cut] people who came from outside of Europe."" Emily Thornberry MP, 19 April 2018 It’s correct that governments since 2010 have set a target to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, and this target has never been met. Net migration actually rose to more than three times the target at one point and latest figures for the 12 months to September 2017 estimate it at 244,000.  Net migration is the difference between the number of people immigrating to the UK in a year and the number of people emigrating abroad. In order to meet the target the government would have had to reduce non-EU immigration heavily, because it can’t control the scale of EU (including British) immigration to the UK due to the EU’s rules on free movement. It made some early progress towards this in 2012 and 2013, but the numbers have risen back to roughly 2010 levels again. So even without any EU net migration, the target would only have been met in parts of 2012 and 2013. The government actually looked unlikely to meet the target as early as 2011, when its own impact assessments of its policies suggested reductions to non-EU immigration wouldn’t be enough to meet the target. The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said at the time that “current policies can be expected to deliver about half the reduction in non-EU net migration required to achieve the tens of thousands target by 2015”—though it stressed there was a great deal of uncertainty to all of the estimates. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Correct. Significant reductions to non-EU immigration will have been needed given the government can’t control the volume of EU immigration. But non-EU levels are now roughly what they were back in 2010, so the target is far from being met.

The Sun, 23 September 2015 (£) As the EU reached a decision on relocating 120,000 migrants within its borders, national newspapers once again focused their attention on immigration and asylum, with a number of claims being made about the number of people arriving in Europe and the UK—and where they were coming from. One million asylum applications are expected in Europe this year, and the EU border was crossed illegally 500,000 times between January and the end of August. But the 300,000 migrants arriving by sea are already included in the 500,000 figure given. The 558,000 people the UK 'took in' is the total number of foreign nationals that moved to the UK in 2014, not just asylum seekers, and not just people from developed countries. One million asylum applications expected in Europe this year The report referenced in the Sun's article—published annually by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)—predicted that up to one million asylum applications would be made in Europe in 2015. The number of people it expects to be granted refugee (or similar) status, and so get to stay, is in the region of 350,000 to 450,000. This figure is just for asylum applications, not total migration into the EU. As the OECD notes, humanitarian reasons are a small factor in people moving to rich countries. These estimates are uncertain, and Germany alone expects to receive 800,000 asylum applications in 2015. There have been 500,000 illegal crossings of the EU border so far, including arrivals by sea The OECD states that more than 500,000 illegal border crossings were recorded by the European border agency (Frontex) from January to the end of August, more than double the total number for the whole of 2014. The number of illegal border crossings isn't necessarily a good measure of the number of people arriving. Frontex states that some migrants are counted crossing the EU's border twice; once when they enter Greece from Turkey, and then again when they cross into Hungary from Serbia. Tens or hundreds of thousands of people could be double counted in this way. We might be better off looking at the separate figures for people first landing in the EU by sea. The OECD says that 330,000 migrants have arrived by sea. The Sun has added these to the 500,000 border crossings to imply that over 800,000 people have already come to Europe, but as the OECD confirmed to us, those people are already included in the 500,000 total. The OECD seems to be relying on Frontex for the number of arrivals by sea, although more recent estimates from other sources are closer to the half a million mark. The UK figures are complicated The 558,000 people arriving in Britain in 2014 weren't just from developed countries. That figure is for all non-British nationals moving into the UK in 2014. The total number of people arriving in the UK would be higher, as some British people would have returned from overseas. But at the same time, large numbers of non-British nationals left the UK in 2014. The Office for National Statistics data for 2014 shows that net migration, counting people of all nationalities (British and foreign), was about 312,000.

139,fullfact,"The European Commission is setting up an EU army to protect the borders.
","""EU army to protect borders… the European Union's first paramilitary force would have the power to take control of a nation's borders"" The Times, 16 December 2015 ""British guards will join an armed European Union border force… Critics last night warned the creation of the body... was in effect the formation of an ""'EU navy'"" Daily Mail, 16 December 2015 These claims refer to the European Commission's proposal to upgrade Frontex, an agency that helps manage the EU's external borders. The plan revealed yesterday would give an expanded agency some frontline staff, as well as access to a pool of armed border guards provided by member states. It proposes that in some circumstances, these could be deployed in most EU countries even against their wishes. That isn't the case for the UK, which can't be forced to provide or accept EU border guards. The government has reportedly volunteered to help with the EU's border control efforts. More powers proposed for expanded EU border agency The Commissioner responsible for migration says that the new European Border and Coast Guard Agency will have more powers than its predecessor. ""Where Frontex used to be limited to supporting Member States in managing their external borders, the new Border Agency will go beyond this. What we are creating today is more Europe."" The proposed new border agency would ""oversee the effective function of border control"", carrying out a ""supervisory role"". It would also be able to ""intervene directly"" in some cases if given permission by the Commission, even if the host country objects. That could happen where there's ""disproportionate migratory pressure"" on the border, for example. This does seem a step up from helping national border agencies to work together, although they would retain day-to-day control of the border. But this element of the plan may be illegal, according to one expert. And it could yet be blocked by governments, as the Commission proposal has to be passed by the Parliament and Council of Ministers. Most border guards would be provided by governments  The agency will have more staff compared to Frontex. It expects to have 1,000 people by 2020, compared to around 400 for Frontex. While at the moment all Frontex staff are administrators, the Commission told us that some of those working for the new agency would be operational staff. But it hasn't decided how many. Some of those working for the agency would be on secondment from member states. In addition to these 1,000 members of staff, the plan envisages a ""standing corps"" of 1,500 frontline border guards, available for deployment by the EU border agency at three days' notice. These, it says, would be provided and paid by member states. EU border guards would be under the instructions of the country in which they're stationed. It isn't immediately clear how this would work if they were sent in against that country's wishes. Is a border force the same as a military force? It depends what you consider a military force. The agency would be able to buy its own ""technical equipment"", including the likes of patrol ships and helicopters. The plan also refers to border guards carrying weapons. This proposal comes from the Commission's migration and home affairs department, rather than any of the EU's defence or foreign policy bodies. So from that point of view, the Commission doesn't seem to consider it a military matter. In the same way, the UK's own border agency is part of the Home Office rather than the armed forces. The Mail also reports that ""guards will wear the uniform of their home country with an arm band marked with the EU's insignia"". This is correct, and would make it the same as for joint EU military operations currently. As we've written previously, this military co-operation isn't as far-reaching as a standing EU army or navy. While some politicians would like to see that, there are no immediate plans that we're aware of, and it would require a unanimous decision.","This refers to Commission proposals for a new border agency with increased powers, including the ability to operate in a country despite its objections. Most, if not all, of its border guards would be provided by member countries. The UK isn't covered by this plan.

140,fullfact,"There are plans for an EU army. 
","""This is a dangerous fantasy. The idea that there's going to be a European air force, a European army, it is simply not true."" Nick Clegg, 2 April 2014 ""European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called for the creation of a European army"" BBC News, 9 March 2015 ""The EU has a long record of creating institutions through the 'back door' and the creation of a EU Army will be no different. All of a sudden, the British public will be presented with a 'done deal' and British troops will find themselves operating under the EU flag rather than the Union flag."" UKIP, 4 May 2015 The EU doesn’t currently have an army. It does encourage military co-operation between member countries, which already run joint operations under an EU banner, and some European politicians would like to see this take the form of stand-alone EU armed forces. Member countries would have a veto on any such plans, so the UK would only take part if it chose to. European military force is still a matter for national governments The EU doesn’t have the legal power to act in this area unless member governments actively give their permission. The EU treaties do allow for “the progressive framing of a common defence policy that might lead to a common defence”. This is the place where EU heads of state or government meet at least four times each year, but more often if necessary. It plays a major role in setting the EU’s overall agenda and is the EU’s ultimate political authority. It was the European Council that decided to accept David Cameron’s renegotiation package. But this “common defence” will only come about “when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides”. Unlike in other areas of EU decision-making, the European Commission can’t propose laws about security and defence, and any decisions in these areas must be made unanimously. That means that the UK effectively has a veto. UK law also states that no such common EU defence powers can be handed from the UK to the EU without the approval of parliament and a referendum on the decision. So the government would need the support of both the public and MPs before they could make such a decision. The treaties don’t say what “common defence” means exactly. Presumably, while you could have a “common defence” without an EU army, creation of an EU army couldn’t happen without a “common defence” being formally approved by each individual government. So while UKIP is correct to say that there’s supposed to be a gradual development of shared responsibilities in this area, an EU army couldn’t be brought into existence without the agreement of the UK (and other EU member countries, many of which reportedly don’t think it’s a good idea). The UK’s position on an EU army The UK doesn’t support an EU army. The government’s position is that: “The Prime Minister has been clear that the UK will never be part of a European Army. We have consistently said that we will oppose any measures which would undermine member states' competence for their own military forces, or lead to competition and duplication with NATO, which is the cornerstone of our defence”. The EU already runs military operations, based on armies working together When people talk about an “EU army”, they seem to mean armed forces recruited by, and under the central command of, an EU organisation which could deploy them as it sees fit. Military operations are already managed at EU level. The first of these began in 2003 in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia under the control of the EU Political and Security Committee of member countries’ ambassadors. Other operations followed in the Congo, and Bosnia Herzegovina in 2004—that one is still going on. The EU currently has six ongoing military operations in non-EU countries, and another dozen ‘civilian missions’. An important difference between these operations and an “EU army” is that they rely on member countries to provide the boots on the ground. The Union doesn’t directly employ soldiers. Its military operations, and stand-by ‘Battlegroups’, are formed from various armies working together. On a practical level, this shows up in soldiers on EU missions wearing EU badges on their regular army uniforms. In terms of high-level organisation, the EU Military Committee is made up of Chiefs of Defence from each country. The EU Military Staff reporting to it are on secondment from the armed forces of member states—the European Commission told us that the dozen UK military personnel on the Military Staff “remain employees of the UK Government”. EU military operations are also financed from a separate pot of money from the centralised EU budget. EU member states can have closer cooperation between their armies Member countries who want greater defence cooperation can work together without the involvement or backing of all members. This is referred to as ‘permanent structured cooperation’. These countries can then coordinate on a number of areas including operational planning, training and sharing equipment. Leave campaigners have claimed that the UK would be forced into an ‘EU army’ under the rules allowing for these activities. But even if you think this kind of cooperation amounted to an EU army, which isn’t clear, it’s entirely optional. Member countries also have the option to leave these agreements further down the line if they wish to. So far no EU countries have taken up this option. Some people would like an EU army, but there aren’t concrete plans for one Proposals reported in May 2016 as “the first step towards an EU army” referred to a push for permanent structured cooperation, to be tabled after the UK membership referendum. There are plenty more examples of EU politicians pushing for more defence integration. Proposals put forward in 2013 involved “assets directly purchased, owned and operated by the Union”, although the EU said that this referred to non-military equipment. These mirror the desire of the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, for “at least some integrated defence capacities”. He’s also made a more specific call for a joint EU army, in an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag. A paper published by his European People’s Party political grouping called for “an EU strategic civilian and military headquarters” and, in the long run, “European stand-by forces under Union command”. So we know that some players on the EU political scene would like the Union to be able to use military force on its own. Accordingly, experts in European issues and defence policy have been debating whether or not it’s realistic and a good idea. But, politically, it seems a fairly distant prospect at present. The 2013 proposals we mentioned, for instance, were welcomed by the European Council of national leaders on the pointed condition “that the capabilities are owned and operated by the Member States”. The European Council has given defence and security policy more attention recently. After a recent meeting, it said that the EU should be doing things like “fostering greater and more systematic European defence cooperation to deliver key capabilities, including through EU funds”. While this suggests that countries will work more closely together in future, it’s not a resounding call for an EU army.","EU member countries work together on military matters, but the EU doesn't have its own military capabilities. At least a few European politicians do support the creation of an EU army, but that would need unanimous approval.

277,fullfact,"1.8 million migrants entered the EU illegally in 2015.
"," “A massive 1.8 million illegal migrants entered Europe last year – six times more than in 2014” Daily Express, 6 April 2016  1.8 million illegal border crossings into the EU were detected by member states in 2015. This doesn’t mean that 1.8 million migrants came to the EU illegally. One person can cross into the EU multiple times, particularly if they’re travelling across parts of south eastern Europe. It’s thought that these detections are associated with around one million people. The organisation which compiles and publishes the figures—the EU’s border agency Frontex—says that: “Irregular border crossings may be attempted by the same person several times in different locations at the external border. This means that a large number of those who were counted when they arrived in Greece were again counted when entering the EU for the second time through Hungary or Croatia.” This has a significant effect on the figures. Of the 1.8 million detected crossings, 885,000 were through the eastern Mediterranean, mostly from Turkey into Greece. Another 765,000 crossings were detected through the western Balkans into countries like Hungary and Croatia. It’s well known this is a big route for migrants entering Europe from the Middle East, since the majority who enter Greece don’t apply for asylum there, according to Frontex. Frontex itself says these 1.8 million detections correspond with an estimated one million migrants entering Europe in 2015. We’ve asked Frontex for its source here. A similar figure has been estimated by the UN and the International Organisation for Migration. Even though there aren’t as many people as detections, 2015 was an unprecedented year for arrivals into the EU as today’s reports suggest. Those 1.8 million detections compare to less than 300,000 in 2014 and just over 100,000 in 2013. At the same time the number of detections is only as good as the amount of effort member states spend monitoring the flow of migrants illegally into the EU. There’s no way to know exactly how many people have entered the EU illicitly. Even though the 1.8 million figure has been widely reported today, we knew there were roughly this many detections in 2015 back in January this year.","This is incorrect as far as available figures show. 1.8 million illegal border crossings were detected by EU member states in 2015, but this isn’t 1.8 million unique people as some are counted multiple times. It’s thought around one million migrants came over the same period.

278,fullfact,"Less than half of the migrants entering Europe are from Syria.
","“Philip Hammond says less than half of migrants are fleeing war-torn Syria” The Sun, 2 February 2016 The Foreign Secretary’s claim, as reported by the Sun and Mail, is correct. Just under half of migrants and asylum seekers who've recently crossed into Europe over the Mediterranean are Syrian citizens. 48% of people arriving in Europe by sea since the beginning of 2015 have been from Syria, according to the United Nations refugee agency. That’s around 519,000 people. Many others were from Afghanistan and Iraq. Around one in three people seeking asylum were Syrian towards the end of last year The 48% are just the people arriving in Europe, not those who have applied for refugee status, still less been granted it. Towards the end of last year, one in every three people applying for asylum in the EU for the first time were from Syria, up from the one in five reported a few months ago. In the first three months of 2015, 16% of asylum applications in the EU were from Syrians. In the next three-month block, it was 21%.

269,fullfact,"The UK has taken in only 216 Syrian refugees. 
","""Number of Syrian refugees Britain has taken in would fit on a Tube train"" The Independent, 2 September 2015 ""The UK has accepted 216 Syrian refugees. Germany has accepted 800,000."" George Eaton, New Statesman Political Editor, 2 September 2015 Today's papers are dominated by images of a drowned Syrian child. It serves as a reminder that behind the numbers thrown around in the increasingly heated asylum debate are human lives. The UK has taken in about 5,000 Syrian refugees since 2011 From the beginning of the Syrian crisis in early 2011 to the second quarter of 2015, the UK granted asylum or another form of humanitarian protection to just under 5,000 Syrians in the initial decision made on their application. A London underground train carries fewer than 900 people. In addition to those people, 216 Syrian refugees have been resettled in the UK The figures above refer to people granted asylum after arriving in the UK. In addition to these people, the UK has taken in 216 people under the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation scheme. One of a number of organisations concentrating on this figure is the Refugee Council.  This graphic presents the 216 people resettled to the UK in the context of the total number of Syrian refugees. It's not immediately clear that the group of people resettled in the UK is not the total number of Syrian refugees here. Resettlement versus asylum A person must be in the UK to make an application for asylum for themselves and their dependents. However, the most vulnerable people may not be capable of undertaking the journey from Syria to the UK, or may have dependents that can't make that journey. The Vulnerable Persons Relocation scheme gives Syrian refugees a chance to be resettled in the UK. It focuses on transferring refugees from the region of Syria to the UK. The scheme targets the refugees ""at greatest risk"", where ""evacuation from the region is the only option"", according to the government. It says that particular attention is paid to survivors of torture and violence, or women and children who need medical care. The scheme was launched after the UN refugee agency asked countries to take in 130,000 Syrian refugees above and beyond their ordinary asylum intake. On that measure, the UK's 216 to date compares to 35,000 places made available by Germany, but other EU countries have taken in similar numbers to us.","The UK has taken in around 5,000 Syrian refugees. The 216 figure refers to an additional number resettled from around Syria under one particular scheme.

162,fullfact,"The EU wants to force the UK to take a share of refugees. 
"," ""Brussels, Germany and France want to force all EU nations—including Britain—to take their share of up to 160,000 refugees."" Daily Express, 4 September 2015 European leaders can't ""force"" the UK to take a quota of refugees from elsewhere in the EU, or anywhere else for that matter. The reported EU proposal to relocate 120,000 asylum seekers from countries like Hungary, Greece and Italy appears to be on top of a plan first floated in May this year, which sought to distribute 40,000 people among other member states. This explains the reference to 160,000 by the Express. Such a scheme might compel most member states to accept more asylum seekers, but the UK is an exception. We have what's often referred to as an opt-out, although strictly speaking what happens is that EU laws on the likes of asylum and border control don't apply to the UK unless we choose to opt in. The European Commission acknowledged as much in its proposals in May, and again in its more recent proposals. It left the UK out of its calculations for what it considered a fair scheme for relocating asylum seekers within the EU, and similarly seemed to accept that Britain couldn't be forced to resettle people from outside the EU either. Relocation versus resettlement The various proposals advanced recently appear to be for internal relocation from EU countries most affected by recent migration, rather than resettlement from countries around Syria. The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, seems to be describing internal relocation in referring to the need for 100,000 refugee places. So does the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, António Guterres, who wants 200,000 places. This would be a temporary change from the current system of new arrivals being concentrated in the country they first arrive in, as the rules usually demand. The French and German leaders appear supportive of this concept, as the Express reported. These relocation schemes for existing asylum seekers are different to proactively bringing in more refugees from countries near Syria, as the Prime Minister is considering. Mr Cameron's plans are a voluntary effort on the part of the UK. Update 10 September 2015 We added more details about the European Commission's September proposals on relocation of asylum seekers.","Unlike most other EU member states there would be no legal requirement for the UK to take a ""quota"" of refugees if such a scheme were passed.

According to YouGov's Anthony Wells, it's the closest gap pollster ICM has found of late. He said the company's polls typically show 'remain' as having a lead of around six points. It's not the only poll this week to show such a close gap. Another pollster, Survation, found a similar gap, although it was the other way around. It found 40% support for 'remain' and 42% for 'leave'. Since then, two more polls have shown a rather larger gap. ComRes and Ipsos MORI found strong leads for 'remain' (21 and 26 points respectively). The methods of the poll can affect the results It matters whether the poll was conducted by telephone or online. The telephone polls found a large lead for 'remain', while the online polls showed a more even picture. This is consistent with the findings of an experiment by ComRes. It asked the same question—the one that will be asked in the referendum—on an online and telephone survey. Both were weighted in the same way, and were run within days of each other. In the online poll it was neck and neck, with 41% opting to remain and the same proportion opting to leave. The results of the telephone poll were very different: 56% opted to remain and 35% opted to leave. ComRes says this may be down to differences in the types of voters in the referendum. For general election polling, the vast majority of the electorate vote the same way every time, according to ComRes. A referendum is different, because it said there are many more ""low information"" voters—those who haven't made their mind up yet—meaning that any polling will be particularly sensitive to differences in the political engagement of the people being surveyed. People choosing to sign up to an online panel are more ""online savvy"". ""They are more likely to be engaged on social media and exposed to strongly held beliefs that we see in online encounters"", ComRes says. Being in a panel and being regularly asked about their beliefs can make people more engaged and aware of the issues. It concludes: ""Whatever the reason for the methodological differences, the referendum race is not currently on the knife edge portrayed by some. This is not to say that Britain will definitively vote to remain a part of the European Union — past experience of referendums in the UK suggests the final voting blocs tend to fall into place only in the final few weeks before the vote, and on this occasion we don't even have a date for polling day."" Some polls ask different questions As Independent columnist John Rentoul has said today, part of it is also down to question wording. He points to analysis by Ipsos MORI finding that when people were asked if they support ""giving 16 and 17 year olds the right to vote"" in the referendum, more were in favour, but when asked if they supported ""reducing the voting age from 18 to 16"" for the referendum, more were against it. Most of these polls asked the question that will be in the referendum: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"", with the options ""Remain a member of the European Union"", ""Leave the European Union"". Pollsters also offer the option ""don't know"". Ipsos MORI tried out two different questions, one asking the referendum question and the other asking whether people wanted to ""stay in"" or ""get out"". Those responding to the stay in/get out question were less likely to pick to stay than those asking the remain/leave question. In a separate poll published today, Lord Ashcroft asked people to place themselves on a scale between zero and 100, zero meaning they would definitely vote for the UK to remain in the EU, 100 meaning they would definitely vote to leave.  38% placed themselves between zero and 49 and 47% placed themselves between 51 and 100, meaning more wanted to leave. Some evidence that the gap has tightened since summer Professor Curtice says that on the basis of the Ipsos MORI poll, Survation poll and another one by YouGov, there is some evidence that there has been a smaller gap during the autumn than during the summer. But as with all polls, that's still uncertain.","This is uncertain. While two polls have shown a narrow gap between the 'remain' and 'leave' camps, others have shown significant gaps between the two. Different methods give different results, with telephone polls showing 'remain' with a strong lead and online polls showing a more narrow gap.

142,fullfact,"A poll has shown that Britain wants to quit the EU.
","“100,000 say no to EU: Poll proves Britain wants out” Daily Express, 11 February 2016 “92% want to quit the EU” Daily Express, 5 February 2016 An online poll hosted by the Express online has made the front page of its daily newspaper twice in the last week. The survey isn’t representative, and so the fact that over 90% of those who completed it said they’d prefer to leave the EU doesn’t tell us much about what “Britain” or “Brits” want. Last week’s “92%” headline drew some criticism for this, and although the headline is now a bit more cautious in saying instead that 100,000 had voted to exit the EU, it still says the poll “proves” that Britain wants to leave. The ‘remain’ side has been slightly ahead for the past four months, according to the “poll of polls” published by non-partisan information site What UK Thinks: EU. This is the average level of support across the six most recently published professional polls. At the time of writing, ‘remain’ has 51% and ‘leave’ has 49%. Pollsters might not have the best reputation at the moment, after they consistently underestimated the Conservative’s lead over Labour in last May’s general election. An inquiry into the issue found that Conservative voters were underrepresented in poll samples. Different methods produce different results—so far in the EU referendum campaign we’ve seen that telephone polls are more likely to find a lead for the ‘remain’ camp than online polls are. So no poll, or poll of polls, should be taken as the definitive answer on this. But professional pollsters do at least try to get a representative result, for example by choosing people at random. Online polls such as the Express’s, on the other hand, are completed by whoever wants to complete them. Where they are featured and what they ask will attract specific types of people, and so represent their views rather than that of the average voter.  We are seeking a correction from the Express.","The survey wasn’t representative, so doesn’t tell us much about what voters as a whole want. Taken together, polls have so far suggested a slight lead for the ‘remain’ camp so far.

Daily Express, Wednesday 21 January The story on the front page of today's Express refers to the results of a ""ballot"" organised by two local Conservative MPs and a parliamentary candidate, and limited to their three neighbouring constituencies in Northamptonshire, according to the paper. They say they delivered 100,000 ""ballot papers"" to households over several months in 2014, and counted the 14,581 they got back in the Daily Express offices.

The Express exercise doesn't give us a good fix on what the wider public think.  We've pointed out before that polls are only useful if those replying are representative of wider opinion—no matter how many people are asked. The British Polling Council say that surveys where the participants are self-selecting are problematic. The Express front page does make clear how the ballot was conducted, but both the print and online headlines overstate its importance.","This ""ballot"" says nothing about the state of nationwide opinion.

144,fullfact,"Only 6,000 asylum seekers have been relocated from Italy and Greece to other EU countries under a scheme meant to relocate 160,000 people.
","“Europe’s flapship refugee scheme was branded a flop last night after figures revealed just 5,600 out of a 160,000 target had been relocated” The Sun, 29 September 2016 This is correct, according to figures from the European Commission. But it says that the target is no longer 160,000; it’s now committed to relocating up to 100,000 people from Italy and Greece. New proposals might require EU countries to ‘resettle’ the remaining quota of 60,000 people from countries outside the EU instead. The Migration and Home Affairs department said that 5,651 asylum seekers had been relocated from Italy and Greece to other European countries, as of 27 September. The EU uses ‘relocate’ to talk about transferring asylum seekers within the EU (and a few other countries like Switzerland), whereas ‘resettlement’ refers to refugees being brought directly from the Middle East. Relocating asylum seekers within Europe was agreed last year These are people who have crossed into Europe and applied for asylum, but haven’t had a decision yet. They aren’t eligible to be relocated unless they are citizens of a country from which asylum applications to EU countries are successful at least 75% of the time. That applies to a handful of countries, including Syria and Eritrea. Iraqis also used to be successful in their asylum applications more than 75% of the time, but aren’t any more, and so are no longer eligible for relocation. Almost 2,000 of those relocated so far have gone to France, with no other country taking more than a thousand. The UK isn’t taking part in the scheme, as it has an opt-out. Target of 160,000 has been revised down to 100,000 The Commission said in September 2015 that it would “relocate a total of 160,000 people in clear need of international protection in the coming two years”. But that’s no longer the ambition. The Commission told us that the commitment is now to relocate up to 100,000 people. It said that’s partly because 54,000 of the 160,000 people were meant to be relocated from Hungary. As Hungary opposed the plan, so this number were never allocated. The intention is that EU countries will now be asked to re-settle this number of refugees from Turkey instead. This proposal needs to be signed off by the Council. The Commission also said that there aren’t enough people of the nationalities eligible to be relocated to fill all the places anyway. It says there are around 30,000 people still in Greece that are eligible, whereas its quota is for over 60,000.  The UK isn’t the only EU country not to participate in the relocation scheme, which has proved controversial in some countries. The Hungarian government doesn’t want to accept any asylum seekers under the plan, and will shortly hold a referendum on it. Sweden has been relieved of its obligations to relocate people for the time being, due to the number of asylum seekers the country is already dealing with. This is separate from efforts to resettle refugees from countries near Syria The Commission says that “the groundwork needed for making relocation work has been laid and significant progress achieved”. It’s making better progress on a plan to resettle refugees from countries in the Middle East (as opposed to relocating people already in the EU). Almost 11,000 of a 23,000 target have been resettled, counting those brought over from Turkey under the terms of a separate deal agreed in July to try to discourage people from crossing into Europe by sea.

287,fullfact,"Lebanon, a country the size of Devon and Cornwall, shelters 1.5 million refugees compared to 150,000 in the UK.
","A tweet posted this morning says that Lebanon is the size of Devon and Cornwall combined, and that it shelters 1,500,000 refugees to the UK’s 150,000.   The first part of this claim has done the rounds on social media before and is accurate: Lebanon is 10,400 km², while the combined area of the traditional counties Devon and Cornwall is 10,270 km². The second part is trickier. Lebanon hosts just over a million Syrian refugees, according to the United Nations. This is in addition to around half a million other refugees, most of them Palestinians, who are registered with a separate UN agency. That figure is disputed, however, with recent research indicating that only around half that number are actually in the country. It’s also complicated to work out the ‘refugee’ population of the UK. The Home Office told us that it doesn’t keep a running total. The UN gives a figure of 123,000 refugees in the UK, plus 46,000 people with an asylum application being processed. Last year, it was 117,000 plus 36,000 pending applications—which may be the source of the claim that there are 150,000 refugees living here. But as there’s no definitive number for refugees in the UK, there are other ways this could be calculated. The UN gets its figure by counting the number of people who have been granted asylum in the past 10 years. People who were accepted as refugees more than 10 years ago don’t appear as ‘refugees’ in its statistics. Refugees can apply to become British citizens after six years. It seems reasonable to stop describing people as refugees after 10 years, as the circumstances of people in the UK for a decade or longer will often be very different to those fleeing recent persecution. For many of Lebanon’s refugees, there is no similar path to citizenship. Its large Palestinian refugee population is made up of people who fled Israel/Palestine after the war of 1948—as well as subsequent conflicts, notably the Six Day War—and their descendants. These Palestinian refugees generally can’t get Lebanese citizenship. They have “limited access to government services,” according to the UN, and “have to depend almost entirely on [the UN] for basic services”. They can’t own their own home and many still live in refugee camps. So there are Palestinians who have lived in Lebanon for decades, or were in fact born there, who still qualify as refugees legally and live lifestyles similar in many respects to people who have fled persecution more recently. That complicates the comparison with the UK, which has no equivalent population. Refugees who have arrived in the UK since World War Two will have eventually been absorbed as citizens. None of this to deny Lebanon has a great number of refugees. Even allowing for some variation in the figures, it hosts more refugees per head than any other country: 1 for every 4 Lebanese citizens. The equivalent for the UK, based on the figures above, would at its maximum be 1 in 380.","Lebanon is the size of those counties combined, and the figures are in the right ballpark, although Lebanon’s refugee population is unusual in that many have been “refugees” for decades or from birth, which isn’t possible in the UK.

270,fullfact,"Germany has accepted 800,00 Syrian refugees. 
","  ""The UK has accepted 216 Syrian refugees. Germany has accepted 800,000."" George Eaton, New Statesman Political Editor, 2 September 2015 Last week we wrote about the claim that the UK has accepted 216 Syrian refugees to Germany's 800,000. While we came to a clear conclusion that the 216 figure wasn't correct (an additional 5,000 Syrians have been granted refugee status or a similar form of humanitarian protection here since 2011), we didn't address the claim that Germany has accepted 800,000 Syrian refugees. A reader has asked whether that's accurate. Germany hasn't accepted 800,000 Syrian refugees, on any measure From 2011 to 2014, Germany received around 460,000 asylum seekers in total, from all countries. It expects to receive 800,000 in 2015, again from all countries (not just Syria), and a significant proportion of these will not be given refugee status. Only 210,000 of these projected 800,000 had applied for asylum in Germany by the end of July, according to Eurostat figures, but the government says that its forecast reflects the greater number of people actually entering the country intending to apply, not just those already in the system. Fewer than 50,000 Syrians applying for German asylum this year so far Something like 40,000 or 45,000 (depending on your source) of the people who had begun an asylum application in Germany between January and the end of July this year were Syrian. Since the start of the Syrian crisis in 2011, around 105,000 Syrians have applied for asylum in Germany, compared with 7,000 in the UK. Most of them are likely to be accepted as refugees.    Granted, that doesn't take into account the lag time in application processing mentioned by the German government, or indeed the influx of the past few weeks. But it's still a long way off 800,000. Germany has, in addition to the ordinary asylum process for people who make their own way there, made available 35,000 places for refugees to be resettled from the Syrian region. There are also new EU proposals for 160,000 asylum seekers to be relocated from EU countries like Greece, Italy and Hungary, of which Germany would take a large share. So there's no doubt that Germany will end up accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees, both from Syria and the wider world.","Germany will end up accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees, both from Syria and the wider world, but 800,000 Syrians accepted to date is way off.

","  ""There's lots of media about refugees being predominantly male. Any actual facts on this please?"" Via Twitter, 9 September 2015 ""I was just wondering if you had any facts in regards to the amount of men refugees vs women/children?"" Via email, 14 September 2015 A few readers have asked us to check whether it's accurate to say that refugees are predominantly male. The majority of the 400,000 first-time asylum applicants to EU countries over the first six months of this year have been male. 57% were males over the age of eighteen, 26% children and 18% females over the age of eighteen (and in a handful of cases, the age or gender was unknown). The gender split overall was 72% male, 28% female.  The figure for children covers those listed on a parent's or guardian's asylum application, as well as those who applied by themselves, as 23,000 children did in 2014 (we don't have a breakdown for this year). Looking only at those over the age of eighteen, just under four out of every five applicants were male in June 2015, the latest month for which we have complete data. These figures wouldn't include any irregular migration (entering a country without legal permission) by people who don't go on to seek asylum, and don't cover the reported surge in migrants entering Europe since the end of June. On that point, though, the United Nations estimates that of all the migrants arriving in the EU by sea this year, 69% have been men (as of late September). In the refugee camps around Syria, where there are over 4 million registered refugees, the gender split is around 50:50 according to the UN. Update 21 September 2015 We added an overall gender split, and the words ""of both genders"" to our overall verdict. Update 24 September 2015 We added a more up-to-date estimate from the UN covering all migration to date.","In the EU, 57% of new asylum applicants in the first six months of 2015 were men, 26% were children of both genders, and 18% were women.

Peter Sutherland, UN Special Representative for International Migration, 30 July 2015 The broad picture is right, but Mr Sutherland understated the number of asylum seekers that the UK gets, in comparison to other EU countries, when he spoke to the BBC's World at One about the Calais situation. The figures given correspond to the number of people applying for international protection for the first time in 2014, including family members. But the UK has around 31,000 applicants, not 24,000, in those statistics. You only get close to 24,000 by looking at the number of main applications for asylum in the UK, excluding family members. There were 25,000 such applications made here last year, and 24,000 in 2013. So Mr Sutherland seems to be comparing the total number of asylum seekers in these countries with a subtotal in the UK. We've asked his office for a comment on whether this is right, or if he's using a different source (we're working from Eurostat figures). On a like-for-like comparison, the EU countries receiving the most first-time asylum applicants in 2014 were as follows:  The UK is the sixth highest in the EU in terms of both people applying and people accepted for international protection. In terms of asylum applicants as a share of population, the UK is 18th out of 30 European countries, according to the EU Asylum Support Office.

271,fullfact,"The UK population is 61.6 million, of whom 194,000 are refugees.
"," A reader recently emailed us this graphic, apparently doing the rounds on social media, to ask whether or not it's correct. While the broad picture is right, the exact figures aren't. If anything, this graphic understates its point a little, as the proportion of refugees in the population is less than it suggests. Potentially out-of-date figures The UK population was around 64.6 million according to the latest official estimate, made in 2014. That's the minor matter of 3 million people more than this graphic suggests. Even the 2011 census figure was 63.2 million. It's unclear exactly where the 61.6 million figure came from. The closest official figure to this number we could find is a United Nations estimate of 61.7 million in 2008. As for refugees, the UN refugee agency's latest estimate suggests that in 2014 there were around 117,000 refugees as well as 36,000 pending asylum cases and 16 stateless persons living in the UK. The graphic's figure of 193,510 refugees appears to originate from the UN refugee agency's estimate for 2011, but which confusingly also appears as a separate UN body's estimate for the middle of 2013. We've contacted them to clarify this. So this graphic may actually overstate the proportion of refugees in the population as of last year, when it was 0.18% of the overall population, whereas the numbers in the graphic suggest 0.31%. What does ""refugee"" even mean in this context? You might well wonder why the number of refugees in the UK has gone down in the past few years, given that we accept thousands of new refugees every year. One possible answer is that ""refugees""—people granted refugee status, or a similar form of international protection—don't necessarily remain refugees forever. Refugees can apply to settle in the UK after five years (known as indefinite leave to remain). Once granted indefinite leave to remain, they can apply for citizenship. Some refugees may also return to their country of origin after the initial five years because their status is revoked or not renewed. The UN refugee agency told us that there's no official government figure for the number of refugees in Britain, so it has to estimate. It does so based on the number of successful applications for refugee status in the previous 10 years, as it assumes that anyone here for longer than that has become a British citizen. We're trying to find out more about its methodology. Refugees are a small proportion of the total population, but also of the immigrant population People seeking refugee status here don't contribute hugely to UK immigration—they were less than 5% of immigrants in 2013, accounting for around 8% of net migration. More broadly, the non-UK born population is now one in eight people. There are around five million foreign citizens—one in every 12. You can read more about this in one of our recent articles. Update 20 October 2015 We adjusted our description of the UN refugee agency's estimate for the number of refugees in the UK, following correspondence with the UN.","The latest estimate of the UK population was 64.6 million, as of 2014. The UN's latest estimate suggests that there were 117,000 refugees living in the UK that year.

145,fullfact,"One in five asylum seekers in the EU are from Syria. 
","""Only one in every five migrants claiming asylum in Europe is from Syria"" Daily Mail, 18 September 2015 ""Claim that Syrians make up 'only' one in every five asylum seekers arriving in Europe is flawed"" Guardian, 19 September 2015 The Daily Mail's claim that only one in five of those seeking asylum in the EU recently are Syrian rests on analysis of figures from the EU statistics agency, Eurostat. The claim is correct for the period it covers, but the Guardian is on solid ground in saying that there could be a high proportion of Syrians among more recent arrivals, who aren't in the Eurostat figures. 20% of new asylum applicants were Syrian three months ago The Mail looked at the number of new asylum seekers in April, May and June this year. It's correct that of these 213,000 people, 44,000 (21%, or roughly one in five) were recorded as being Syrian. The Guardian, though, points out that three months is a long time in refugee crises. It says that there has been a surge in people arriving in Europe since the period covered by the Mail's figures, and that more of the recent arrivals will have been Syrian. Significant increase in migration since June, including many Syrians The Guardian points to data from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). This estimates the number of ""irregular maritime arrivals"" across the Mediterranean so far this year, 99% of which land in Greece and Italy. By 17 June, it said there had been around 54,000 in Greece and 59,000 in Italy. By 17 September, the number arriving in Italy had more than doubled, as 63,000 arrived in three months, but for Greece that figure swelled by almost 300,000—nearly five and a half times as many people as were recorded in January-June. The IOM says just under 40% of the total number of arrivals to Europe by sea in 2015 have come from Syria. More of those arriving in Greece, which has recorded the biggest rise, are thought to be Syrian. A third source, the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR), has almost identical figures for Mediterranean sea arrivals, which it tells us come directly from the authorities in Greece and Italy. It thinks that over half of them are Syrian. The difference between this estimate and the IOM's may be because the UNHCR updates its figures more regularly, but we're still trying to work this out. These are just the people recording arriving in the EU, not those who have applied for refugee status, still less been granted it. But it could mean that when they make it into the Eurostat asylum application figures, the proportion of Syrian asylum applicants will be higher than 20%. We can test this to some extent by looking at the Eurostat numbers for Germany, which are published ahead of most EU countries. In April to June, 20% of new asylum applicants there were Syrian, in line with the EU as a whole. That rose to 28% in July and August, which seems to support the Guardian's argument. Even this isn't definitive, as the German government says there is a ""significant delay"" between when a migrant physically arrives in the country and the filing of an asylum application. Some of those arriving in July and August are yet to show up in the application figures for those months. Different sources tell us different things So what source should we be using? They each have their benefits. The Eurostat figures—which we've used in previous articles—are helpful as they give us precise numbers of asylum seekers and refugees, as opposed to all migrants. But it's important to make clear when using them now that they don't cover the recent surge in arrivals, many of which will enter the asylum system. The IOM's and UNHCR's estimates are a lot more up to date, which is helpful in a fast-moving situation like this one. They look only at people arriving in the EU and can't tell us whether or not they will or should be granted refugee status. The IOM told us that its figures are based on self-reported nationality, so there's a risk that some people saying they're Syrian at this point are not, but it's ""impossible to know"" how significant an issue this is. Why does it matter where people come from anyway? The UNHRC also told us that the vast majority of non-Syrian migrants arriving in the Mediterranean come from dangerous countries too, cautioning against any assumption that Syrians have a monopoly on valid asylum claims. The Guardian makes a similar point. It's true that each asylum claim needs to be judged on its own merits. That said, 95% of decisions made on asylum applications to EU countries by Syrians last year were positive, even before appeal—only 5% were rejected. By contrast, 98% of Serbians, 92% of Albanians, 37% of Afghans and 11% of Eritreans were turned away. Being a migrant from Syria is a good indication that someone will ultimately be deemed a refugee from Syria, which isn't the case with all other countries.","This was correct for the EU asylum applications in spring 2015 (the latest figures available). But this was before a more recent surge in arrivals, and there is evidence to suggest that a high proportion of these people are from Syria.

The UK's Syrian refugee programme is slightly ahead of schedule.
","“We as a country are doing one of the biggest programmes we have ever done, 23,000 refugees coming to this country. We are slightly ahead of the schedule that David Cameron set out [...] There are 23,000 Syrian refugees coming to this country, on top of refugees from elsewhere.” Brandon Lewis, 22 February 2018 The government has said it aims to resettle 23,000 refugees in the UK from Syria and the surrounding region by 2020. So far, just over 11,000 refugees have come under two resettlement schemes, the first of which began in earnest in September 2015. Prior to July 2017, those arriving on the scheme didn’t technically have refugee status in the UK, and instead had “Humanitarian Protection”. This gives individuals the right to five years’ residence in the UK, but not the full range of rights (such as access to benefits and support for Higher Education) that someone with refugee status has. Of the 23,000 target, 20,000 are specifically from the conflict in Syria. The other 3,000 are vulnerable children and their families in the Middle East and North Africa. These schemes aren’t the only way for refugees to enter the UK. Another 8,000 Syrian asylum seekers have been granted asylum after applying in the UK since 2011. The Home Secretary yesterday claimed that the the government is “slightly ahead of schedule” in meeting the target to resettle 20,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict by 2020. This seems to be based on just over half of the target number having been resettled in roughly half the time since the target was set. The Home Office told us that everyone who arrives via the government schemes fits the UN’s definition of a refugee. But not all these people were granted refugee status by the UK. Prior to July 2017, they were granted Humanitarian Protection and five years’ stay in the UK. The government summarised the difference in status: “while Humanitarian Protection recognises the need an individual has for international protection, it does not carry the same entitlements as refugee status, in particular, access to particular benefits, swifter access to student support for Higher Education and the same travel documents as those granted refugee status.” Since July 2017, individuals on the scheme have been granted refugee status and five years’ stay in the UK. Those who arrived before that date may request a change to refugee status. Refugees in the UK normally get a residence permit for five years, after which they may apply for permanent residence. For the rest of this piece, we will refer to all people arriving via a government resettlement scheme as a “refugee”. The UK has two different resettlement schemes specifically for refugees from Syria and the surrounding region. Together, these two schemes aim to take in 23,000 people by 2020. Not all of these will necessarily be from Syria, though. In September 2015, then-Prime Minister David Cameron announced “that Britain should resettle up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over the rest of this Parliament”. The commitment to resettling 20,000 refugees by 2020 expanded the ambitions of the existing Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS). Launched in January 2014 to help Syrian refugees, the VPRS had resettled 252 refugees between then and October 2015. The scheme is meant to to identify, with the help of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), “those most at risk and bring them to the UK”. It does not cover Syrian refugees already in Europe. Since July 2017, refugees of any nationality fleeing the conflict in Syria may be considered for the VPRS. The government announced a second resettlement scheme in April 2016. It aims to bring 3,000 vulnerable and refugee children and their families from the Middle East and North Africa to the UK by 2020. Now called the Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme (VCRS), it covers unaccompanied and separated children, as well as “other vulnerable children such as child carers and those facing the risk of child labour, child marriage or other forms of neglect, abuse or exploitation.” Those arriving through both schemes are granted five years’ stay in the UK. These schemes are not the only way enter the UK as a refugee. An individual may apply to the UK as an asylum seeker. An asylum seeker will then have their case considered by the government, to determine whether or not they are a refugee under international law. Government figures released yesterday show that, by December 2017, roughly 10,500 refugees from the Syrian conflict have been resettled under the VPRS. The vast majority were resettled since September 2015. Almost 5,000 were resettled in 2017, and roughly half of them were children. 570 people have been resettled under the VCRS, 539 of whom were in 2017. In addition to this, over 8,000 Syrian asylum seekers and their dependants were accepted refugges in the UK from 2011 to 2017. This means they applied for protection in the UK, rather than having been identified through a government scheme. Overall there were an estimated 119,000 refugees in the UK at the end of 2016, according to the UN. Globally, there are 5.6 million refugees from Syria. 3.5 million are registered in Turkey, and a further two million are in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon according to the UNHCR. 63% of Syrian asylum applications in Europe were made to Germany or Sweden between April 2011 and December 2017. The Home Secretary yesterday claimed that the government is “slightly ahead of schedule” in meeting the 20,000 target. We asked the Home Office for more information on this but they didn’t provide any further detail. Just over 10,000 refugees have arrived in the UK via VPRS, based on figures up to December 2017. The target was set in September 2015, with an end-date of 2020—so just over half the target has been met in roughly half the allotted time period. We don’t know if the pace of resettlement is expected to be the same across the whole period to 2020. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","
 
Roughly correct. Just over 10,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict have come to the UK via a government scheme from September 2015 to December 2017. The target for the scheme is 20,000 by May 2020. Individuals arriving before July 2017 had Humanitarian Protection, rather than refugee status.

Syrian citizens make up a majority on the most obvious measure, although not on others. Syrians make up 28% of the migrants crossing the Mediterranean by sea in 2016, according to the UN refugee agency. So not the majority, but it was more than any other nationality.  The year before that an estimated 48% of those making the crossing said they were from Syria. Of those who made an asylum application in the EU for the first time, around 30% were Syrian between January 2015 and June 2016. Again, that’s far more than any other nationality. Finally, take people actually granted refugee status in the EU. Here a clear majority of people are Syrians: 58% since the beginning of January 2015.

275,fullfact,"In 2017 the UK resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any other EU member state.
","“In 2017 the UK resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any other EU member state (Eurostat figures).” Migration Watch, 13 August 2019 In response to a journalist tweeting that “the only refugee the British government wants to support is a cartoon bear”, the think tank Migration Watch claimed that the UK resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any other EU member state in 2017. The government has previously made a similar claim: ""Since 2016, Britain has resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any other EU state”. Both statements are correct, but there’s some important context which many people might not have picked up from the wording. The term “resettled” is very important here. “Resettled refugees” are not all refugees which a country might take in. It refers to refugees who were resettled in a new country as part of a specific scheme run by that country. Most refugees arrive in the EU as asylum seekers, not as people being resettled as part of a scheme. Four EU countries granted asylum to more refugees than the UK in 2017, and three did in 2018. Eurostat data shows that in 2017 the UK resettled more refugees (6,210) than any other EU country in 2017. The next-highest levels were in Sweden (3,410) and Germany (3,015). In 2018, the UK again resettled the most refugees (5,805), ahead of France (5,565) and Sweden (4,935). A resettled refugee is someone who has been granted permission to reside in a state as a refugee, as part of “a national or Community resettlement scheme”. Most resettled refugees arrive in the UK directly from refugee camps. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) officials determine whether an individual is a refugee while they are in a refugee camp, and the UK then decides who will be offered resettlement. In the UK, refugees are resettled as part of four schemes: The government has a target to resettle 23,000 refugees in the UK from Syria and the surrounding region by 2020, as part of the latter two schemes. The UK also aims to resettle another 5,000 refugees in the first year of a new scheme which begins next year. Resettlement through a national scheme is not the only way to become a refugee in another country. Most refugees who are granted protection in the EU don’t arrive this way. Separate to any resettlement scheme, individuals can apply for asylum directly to another country. Individuals must physically reach the country in question in order to seek asylum. The country will then review their application and “recognise” that person as a refugee if they meet the definition of a refugee set out under the UN Refugee Convention. They may also be given another form of humanitarian protection which does not give exactly the same protections as refugee status. According to UK government data (which differs slightly to the EU data above), as well as the 5,806 refugees who were resettled in the UK in 2018, 7,636 individuals were granted asylum, and 2,449 were granted an alternative form of protection. That gives a total of 15,891 people granted asylum in the UK in 2018, of whom 13,442 were refugees. The UK granted asylum to a similar number of people (14,767) in 2017, of whom 13,681 were refugees. EU data on asylum decisions includes those granted asylum after an appeal, so records a slightly higher number of people granted asylum in the UK in 2018 (17,205, of whom 13,845 were refugees). The data shows that a handful of EU countries granted asylum to more people than the UK in both 2017 and 2018, with Germany taking in far more than anyone else. In 2018, Germany (139,555), Italy (47,885), France (41,440), Austria (20,700) and Sweden (19,605) all granted asylum to more people than the UK. If you only look at asylum granted to refugees (so not people with other forms of humanitarian protection), the UK is fourth behind Germany (61,350), France (27,135) and Austria (14,815). The story is similar in 2017. Germany, France, Italy, Austria and Sweden all granted asylum to more people than the UK, and all but Italy granted asylum to more refugees than the UK. Excluding asylum applications where the outcome was unknown, but including those who were successful after appealing an initial rejection, 35% of asylum applicants to the UK were granted asylum or another form of protection in 2017—the lowest level since 2006.","Technically correct, but resettled refugees are only a subset of all refugees a country might take in. Overall, Germany, France, Austria and Sweden all granted asylum to more refugees than the UK did in 2017.

6,fullfact,"The UK has introduced a special scheme for taking in vulnerable Syrian refugees, and 10,000 Syrian refugees have come to the UK since the conflict began.
","“Surely it is the responsibility of all of us to defend the 1951 refugee convention which commits this country, the United States and 142 other states to accept refugees without regard to their race, religion or country of origin. President Trump has breached that convention. Why didn’t she speak out?” Jeremy Corbyn, 1 February 2017 “This government, and this country, has a proud record of how it welcomes refugees. We've introduced the very particular scheme to ensure particularly vulnerable refugees in Syria can be brought to this country. Something like 10,000 Syrian refugees have come to this country since the conflict began. We're also the second-biggest bilateral donor helping and supporting refugees in the region”. Theresa May, 1 February 2017 The main international agreement when it comes to refugees is the 1951 Refugee Convention, or Geneva Convention. It does indeed say that countries signed up to it “shall apply the provisions of this Convention to refugees without discrimination as to race, religion or country of origin”.  142 countries, including the UK, have signed up to both this Convention and the 1967 extension that took its scope beyond refugees from World War II. The USA is one of a handful that only signed up to the 1967 version (which is the same in most respects). Professor Rhona Smith of Newcastle University Law School wrote on Monday that the executive order issued by the new US administration this week is “very clearly disregarding the Geneva Convention in a number of ways”. It’s true that the UK has accepted over 10,000 Syrian refugees since the conflict began in 2011. But less than half (4,400) have been deliberately brought over from the region under the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement scheme mentioned by the Prime Minister. Another 6,000 travelled to the UK themselves and were subsequently granted asylum (or a similar form of international protection).  The United Nations says that there are 4.9 million Syrian refugees around the world. As to the UK being the second biggest donor in helping Syrian refugees: this is a bit tricky, but the short answer is that we’re there or thereabouts. When we looked at this in November 2015, the UK was definitely second on the list of biggest donors when it comes to the Syrian crisis, according to UN figures. By October 2016, the UK had fallen behind Germany into third.  Using the UN’s latest data: the UK has given around $1.5 billion to two separate Syrian appeals since 2012, with Germany contributed $1.9 billion and the United States $3.4 billion. The Department for International Development says that the UK is still the second largest bilateral donor of humanitarian aid specifically, and that Germany provides much of its aid for longer term development. We’ll look into this further. This fact check is part of a roundup of Prime Minister's Questions. Read the roundup.","It’s correct that over 10,000 Syrian refugees are now in the UK, although not all were brought over under this scheme. More than half made their own way to the UK.

267,fullfact,"A senior judge has said that many of the people in the Calais ""jungle"" migrant camp aren't refugees, but want the UK's ""economic benefits"".
","Of all the things Mr Justice McCloskey had in mind when writing the judgment allowing four Syrian asylum seekers to enter the UK, this morning's Daily Mail front page can't have been among them. The paper leads with ""Migrants: judge who dared to tell the truth. Many in the Calais Jungle AREN'T refugees but want our economic benefits, he says"". The judge did say that many of the people living in the Calais ""jungle"" are probably not refugees, but he did not claim that they want to come to the UK for ""economic benefits"", on any interpretation of that phrase. This is what Mr Justice McCloskey actually wrote in the sixth paragraph of his judgment of 29 January: ""It seems likely that there is no real basis for many of its occupants remaining indefinitely in 'the jungle' and enduring the conditions that obtain there. Many are probably not refugees in any general sense or in any sense entitled to recognition. ""Rather, they are migrant nationals of a number of countries outside the European Union, who, while intending to make a claim for refugee status, decline to make the claim in France due to perceived advantages, correct or otherwise, of doing so in the United Kingdom. ""Like the United Kingdom and other member states of the European Union, France has obligations to asylum claimants and because of the United Kingdom’s ‘opt out’ of recent relevant EU legislation, the duties owed by France are in many respects more onerous than those applying in the United Kingdom. ""In general terms there is no basis at all for thinking that a person who claims asylum in France will not be treated properly and will not have the benefit of the reception and other facilities which those duties entail. ""The first four Applicants, however, are in a special, indeed unique, situation because of their ages, their vulnerability, their psychologically traumatised condition, the acute and ever present dangers to which they are exposed in 'the jungle', the mental disability of the fourth Applicant, the (claimed) relationships linking all seven Applicants, the particular relationship between the third and the fourth Applicants and the firm likelihood that the outcome of asylum applications made by the first four Applicants in France would be a “take charge” acceptance by the United Kingdom."" The ""first four Applicants"" mentioned are three 16 year olds and a 26 year old with a ""serious mental illness"". All told the judge that they're Syrians, and asked to be allowed into the UK to be reunited with three Syrian relatives (the other three of the ""seven Applicants""). Mr Justice McCloskey ordered the Home Secretary to allow them into the UK in order to process their claim for asylum, so long as they first made an asylum application in France. He said that could happen under EU rules anyway, but could take almost a year, and the human right to a family life meant that they should be let into the UK more quickly. The judge emphasised the ""special, indeed unique, situation"" of the asylum seekers involved in the case, suggesting that the decision may not allow migrants into the UK from France en masse. The decision was first made last week, generating headlines on 21 January, but the detailed reasons weren't released until yesterday. The Home Secretary has been given permission to appeal. The public can't read the judgment to see whether our account, or the Mail's claim, is accurate. So far as we're aware, the text was only released to the media. If it were generally available, we'd expect to find it either on the official courts' website or on the specialist BAILII platform. Since that's not the case at time of writing, we've published the version circulated by the Judicial Office. We'll be looking at this again on Monday. In the meantime, here's the judgment. ","One line in a recent judgment says ""many are probably not refugees"", but want to apply for asylum in the UK instead of France ""due to perceived advantages"".

279,fullfact,"The UK's welfare system, public services and lax border controls explain the presence of migrants at Calais trying to cross.
","""The two most fundamental reasons why the migrants are massing at Calais rather than in Italy. First, we are rightly considered a global soft-touch which will provide them with limitless welfare, free healthcare and education. And second, the illegal immigrants are getting through our lax border controls, which only encourages more to come and try their luck"" Daily Mail, 30 July 2015 ""Research suggests that vastly greater numbers of irregular migrants in the UK arrived by air rather than in the back of a truck"", according to experts at Oxford University's Migration Observatory. Those trying to cross by sea or road are well placed to do so from Calais, as it's both geographically close to Great Britain and a transport hub. Generous welfare provision is an unlikely pull factor, since benefits aren't available either to undocumented migrants or asylum seekers, although the latter get a degree of state support and access to public services. The effectiveness of our border security is hard to assess, but there have been past indications of poor performance. ""limitless welfare, free healthcare and education"" Migrants seeking to enter the UK without permission may be asylum seekers claiming to be at risk in their home country, or economic migrants with no claim to humanitarian protection. Asylum seekers are entitled to public services, plus accommodation and a basic living allowance if destitute, but only get the same benefits as UK citizens if protection is granted. Other immigrants who don't have permission to stay are entitled to very little. Asylum seekers are people whose claims for refugee status haven't been decided yet. While they're waiting, they aren't eligible for ordinary benefits. Instead, asylum seekers can apply for government support if they are, or are likely to become, ""destitute"". This can be accommodation, a subsistence allowance, or both. As the National Audit Office put it, the accommodation provided is ""typically a flat or shared house in which the asylum seeker is provided with bedding and basic kitchen equipment as well as basic furniture and access to cooking and washing facilities"", usually outside London and the South East. Cash support to asylum seekers is limited to £36.95 per week for a single person aged 18 or over. It's only after being recognised as a refugee that a person claiming humanitarian protection can claim benefits along the same lines as British citizens. The Mail is correct that asylum seekers can use public services. As the House of Commons Library explains: ""Asylum seekers are eligible for free NHS healthcare and may be eligible for free prescriptions, free dental care, free eyesight tests and vouchers for glasses. Asylum seeker children have the same entitlement to state education as other children and may be eligible for free school meals"". There are, by the way, plenty of asylum seekers in Italy. The figures for the beginning of this year suggest that there were twice as many first-time applicants for asylum there as in the UK. Illegal immigrants can't generally claim British benefits. As ""persons subject to immigration control"", they are specifically excluded from the likes of working tax credit, housing benefit and jobseeker's allowance. Such migrants can use the NHS in England but not, in theory, free except for certain services such as A&E. People who aren't ""ordinarily resident"" here generally have to pay for routine NHS treatment, and you can't be ordinarily resident for these purposes if you're here illegally. But undocumented immigrant children are able to go to school in the UK. ""our lax border controls"" This is difficult to measure, as for obvious reasons it's hard to get a fix on the number of illegal immigrants in the UK. The National Audit Office did find in 2013 that the Border Force was consistently not meeting its target on the number of people refused entry at the border. In the same year, the Public Accounts Committee noted that checks on lorries at Calais were sometimes suspended to prioritise the checking of passports, although the Border Force has said it's since addressed this. Research has suggested that the UK may have the largest population of illegal immigrants in the EU (between 417,000 and 863,000, including children), but this estimate is now very dated. In any case, it doesn't necessarily tell us much about the quality of border controls. The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford says that that ""the consensus among researchers is that the majority of irregular migrants in the UK are likely to be visa over-stayers"", rather than people who have snuck in. The number of enforced removals of people without authorisation to remain in the UK has gradually fallen over the last decade. The number of removals overall, including voluntary departures, was about 40,000 people in 2014.","Benefits aren't available to illegal immigrants, although asylum seekers get some support and use of public services. It's hard to say how secure the border is.

146,fullfact,"The EU proposes to abolish freedom to publish pictures of public buildings. 
","   ""EU Threatens Freedom to Photograph"" UKIP, 22 June 2015 ""How 'absurd' EU copyright law threatens to censor holiday snaps"" The Times, 24 June 2015 'Freedom of panorama', as a rallying cry, sounds like something you'd hear shouted on a BBC picket line by investigative journalists. It turns out to be something far more familiar: the right of people to publish—whether or not for profit—photographs of landmark buildings or public art. Claims that this is under threat at European Union level are accurate up to a point. Restrictions on the commercial use of such images have been suggested by a committee, but it's a long way from that to a new law. Copyrighting a building? In 2002, the US Postal Service released a stamp featuring a photograph of the Korean War Veterans Memorial sculpture in Washington, D.C.. This was protected by copyright law, which stops creative products from being reproduced by others without the permission of the creator—which hadn't been granted. The sculptor sued both the photographer and the Postal Service; and he won. That couldn't happen here because, as every tourist presumably knows, section 62 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 creates an exception to normal copyright rules when it comes to buildings and sculptures ""if permanently situated in a public place or in premises open to the public"". This means that you can take a picture of something like London's Gherkin, show your friends and even sell prints without worrying about being in breach of the architect's copyright in the building. EU law currently allows for freedom of panorama EU rules on copyright currently allow for exceptions like this. But not all member states have them. Notoriously, pictures of the Eiffel Tower lit up at night are subject to copyright, but not photographs taken during the day. What's now been proposed is for 'freedom of panorama' to be restricted when it comes to commercial use of photos or videos. It's not intended to catch personal photographs. But campaigners argue that social media blurs an already tricky distinction between commercial and non-commercial use. Uploading your Gherkin picture to Facebook, for instance, means it can used by Facebook under the terms of a ""royalty-free, worldwide license"" that you grant the company when you sign up. If a social network managed to make money from your picture, it's possible that an aggrieved architect could seek damages for breach of copyright in the absence of freedom of panorama protections. If that's true, though, it's already true in countries like France that don't have freedom of panorama. French social media users sharing those night-time pictures of the Eiffel Tower could technically be in breach of French copyright law. An amendment to a report isn't a diktat from Brussels This is a long way from becoming law. It's gone into a draft report by the European Parliament on EU copyright rules. The MEP coordinating this report describes it as ""not a draft law"". Put another way, this model of simplicity is the European Union's ordinary procedure for making laws. The proposal on freedom of panorama isn't even on the diagram yet, and may never be.  The European Commission, not the Parliament, has the exclusive right to propose new EU legislation. It might take this suggestion on board in drawing up a new copyright regime, due to be published by the end of this year. Equally, it might not. The European Parliament, even if it votes to approve the report in its current form on 9 July, can't force the Commission to follow its recommendations. Update 10 July 2015 The European Parliament has now voted on its recommendations for copyright law. It decisively rejected the idea of restricting 'freedom of panorama', but neither did it push for all EU countries to adopt the same broad exception that applies in the UK, as some MEPs proposed. The final report sent to the European Commission no longer contains any reference to freedom of panorama either way.","The suggestion is to apply copyright protection to images of public buildings for commercial use. It's at an early stage, and may not be taken up by EU legislators.

164,fullfact,"The European Union makes two thirds of UK law.
","Earlier this month a study claiming that almost two thirds of our laws were ""made in Brussels"" was widely reported, appearing in the Express, Mail and Telegraph. We've previously pointed out that this kind of counting exercise is, to some extent, meaningless. We may all be equal before the law, but not all laws are created equal; it's hard to say that an EU regulation on the methods of olive oil analysis is as important as an Act of Parliament restructuring the NHS. But if percentages is the name of the game, we're willing to play. Another shot fired The latest figure has been calculated by the campaign group Business for Britain, which says that 64.7% of UK law is influenced by the EU. It offers this as the ""definitive"" calculation, but also cautions that ""any attempt to make sense of the numbers is highly subjective"". To work out the proportion of UK law derived from EU law, you first need to define what you mean by each of those terms, understand the relationship between them, and do some sums. But the House of Commons Library—which has produced analysis relied upon by Business for Britain—warns that ""there is no totally accurate, rational or useful way"" of making this calculation. What do we mean by 'law'? Let's take UK law. We run into immediate complexities, because the devolved legislatures in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all pass laws that apply only in that nation. Likewise, not all law passed by the Westminster Parliament applies to the whole of the UK. Leaving that aside, there are two main sources of legislation at national level: Acts of Parliament, also known as statutes, and Statutory Instruments (SIs), usually issued by government ministers to flesh out the details of how a statute will work. There are also various types of EU laws, but for the sake of simplicity we can focus on just two. One is the ""regulation"". This applies automatically in all EU member countries—so all EU regulations can be said to be part of UK law. As we'll see, this assumption is important for the end result of any calculation of EU-derived law in this country. The other main type is the ""directive"". This sets out a goal for EU member states to achieve, but doesn't prescribe exactly how it's to be achieved. A directive must be implemented by a national law—in the UK, this is generally done by using an SI. Without counting EU regulations: 13% The House of Commons Library recently released figures on this issue. The focus was ""how much UK legislation implements EU law or other EU obligations"" (with the usual, sensible caveat that this is ""difficult, and most methods are unreliable""). It arrived at an average, between 1993 and 2014, of 13%. That definition excludes EU regulations, which don't need additional UK legislation to be implemented. Counting EU regulations: 65%  Business for Britain built on this by adding EU regulations to the mix. It used the House of Commons Library figures for the number of UK statutes and SIs passed every year, but gave its own figure for the number of EU regulations in existence. The result was 65%. This was arrived at by dividing the number of EU-related laws (including EU regulations) by the total number of laws (including those same EU regulations)—all between 1993 and 2014. How many EU regulations exist? The Business for Britain estimate for the number of EU regulations passed every year is often higher than both the House of Commons Library and the EU calculate. This has the effect of pushing up the final percentage a little. For instance, in 2009 the Library records there having been 1,329 new EU regulations. This is very close to what the EU's own legislative statistics say (1,284). But Business for Britain has calculated it at 1,664. If we use the Library's figures to calculate the proportion of UK law passed that year with an EU connection, we get 53%—but it's 58% using Business for Britain's numbers. Business for Britain used the EUR-Lex database of EU law to search for the regulations passed each year. The difficulty of this approach is that, as the report acknowledges, it's tricky to use the database for this purpose. A basic search made today for regulations in 2014 throws up 1,620 results, but Business for Britain has told us that the exact same search made at the time they compiled their report gave them 1,904. The group has since posted an update discussing these fluctuations, noting that the overall calculation doesn't change much on a renewed search of the database. But the results still seem to include corrections to the original text of regulations, like this one. So the database numbers aren't as reliable as we might wish. Counting EU regulations differently: 62% It may seem surprising that it should be so difficult to get a fix on the number of regulations that exist. This partly reflects the fact that not all of them are particularly important, and partly the flaws of the database—which may be why there are ready-made statistics on the number of laws passed by the EU. For the record, if we carry out the exercise using those figures (counting all regulations recorded there, including ""amending acts"") the result is 62.1%. But we agree with the House of Commons Library that it's a very uncertain exercise. And almost everyone agrees that, whatever the actual percentage, the laws passed at EU level have a significant impact on this country.  ","That's about right if you count EU regulations as part of 'UK law'. The EU influence on UK-only laws is about 13%. But this counting exercise doesn't tell us very much.

308,fullfact,"UK universities get 15% extra money in funding from the EU, on top of what the government gives them. 
","""UK universities receive an additional 15% in funding from the EU, on top of what the UK government gives them. Much of this is for research and development. The UK receives the second largest share of EU research funding."" British Influence, 30 September 2015 British universities don't get a straightforward 15% 'top-up' from the EU on central government funding. This figure is an estimate for the EU money spent here annually on research and development, on top of similar UK government spending. Research grants from 'EU sources' was 2.6% of universities' total income in 2013/14, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency. That was 16% of their total research funding. This doesn't include payments not linked to research, such as the European Social Fund for employment and skills, or money linked to EU students (tuition fees and exchange schemes). Around £730 million a year of EU money is spent on research and development in the UK British Influence told us that its 15% figure is comparing the money allocated by the government for science and research next year with a similar pot of money spent by the EU in the recent past. Organisations in the UK received close to €7 billion through the main EU funding programme for research over 2007-2013, according to the European Commission. This works out at just over £5 billion, at current exchange rates—so around £730 million per year on average. By contrast, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills wants to spend £4.7 billion in 2015/16 on science and research. The EU spending is 15.5% of this (which British Influence has rounded down to 15%). That's not an ideal calculation, as it's comparing past EU spending with future UK spending, and exchange rates have changed a lot over time as well. Using annual exchange rates and comparing the average EU funding awarded in each year of the period covered with what the UK government actually spent every year between 2010 and 2013 pushes the figure up a little, to 18% or 19% each year. Research and development spending isn't all in universities, although a lot is That gives a rough estimate for the EU premium on research and development spending, as British Influence acknowledges in its briefing. It's more problematic to apply the figure to ""universities"" exclusively. UK organisations categorised as ""higher or secondary education"" received around 70% of the EU's funding, and the UK government spending it's being compared with isn't all earmarked for universities either. If 70% of £730 million is going to universities—assuming that few secondary schools are in the picture, in practice—that's around £500 million per year in EU funding for research in UK universities. Universities themselves reported receiving £790 million from 'EU sources' in 2013/14. This figure may be higher the £500 million derived from the European Commission because it takes in more than just grants from the EU itself. It includes grant and contract income from EU-based charities, companies and miscellaneous others. It's also a figure for one particular year, whereas the Commission's figures are an average from 2007-2013, smoothing out fluctuations year by year. Universities themselves say that EU membership is beneficial None of this is to deny that British universities do well financially out of the EU. For example, the second element of the British Influence claim is correct. Only Germany received more from the Commission's research fund than the UK in 2007-2013, and not by much. Our universities are heavily represented in the top 50 of higher education institutions ranked by success attracting in EU grants. Five of the top 10 were British in 2007-2013. This helps to explain why the Russell Group calls the EU ""an irreplaceable source of funding for UK universities"", and umbrella group Universities UK is campaigning for us to remain in the EU. If we left the EU, the government could boost funding to universities with some of the money saved from our £10 billion net contribution to the EU budget, although academics argue that research is an area where we get back proportionally more than we put in.","15%, or a little higher, is a rough estimate of additional EU research and development funding; this isn't only for universities. British higher education providers get at least 2.6% of their total income from the EU, or around 16% of their research income.

Around a third of these were on a work placement. Those taking part represented roughly half a percent of the UK student population, according to the EU's own figures. Almost twice as many European students came to the UK under the Erasmus programme as went abroad from here. 27,100 Europeans studied at a British university in 2012/13.  It's also correct that over 200,000 students studied or worked abroad through Erasmus between 1987 and 2013. In fact, it's 231,000, according to European Commission figures. It's still more than 200,000 if you exclude work placements. We haven't found any more recent statistics than 2012/13. This may be because the scheme was folded into a larger EU programme from 2014, called Erasmus+. Erasmus+ covers a lot more than just undergraduates studying at foreign universities. It also funds exchanges for university staff and vocational courses, as well things like voluntary work and sports programmes.

280,fullfact,"Most students who immigrate to the UK return home after study.
","“Most students return home after study.” Diane Abbott, 12 December 2016 We don’t know how many students return home after studying here, so there’s no clear evidence for this claim. In the words of the Office for National Statistics (ONS): “There are no official figures that show how many students do not emigrate and remain in the UK after their studies.” At the moment, the available evidence is contradictory. Most student immigrants come from outside the EU on a temporary visa, and a minority still have the right to remain after a few years. Diane Abbott’s office pointed us to figures showing this via a Universities UK report, as well as a Times article showing that a small minority of students overstay their visas. At the same time, figures showing how many former international students emigrate are much lower than the figures for students immigrating to the UK. If accurate, that indicates many more students are remaining in the UK than the visa figures would suggest. The ONS and others are working to improve the evidence we have in this area. Even though we can’t be sure of all the figures, we do know that student immigration is adding to the UK population overall. Not all students who come to the UK return home. The challenge is measuring how many do so, and explaining what’s happening to those who don’t. We don’t have precise answers to either question. Most statistics don’t follow individual immigrants and the routes they take through education and beyond. Our main migration estimates, for example, just look at snapshots of one set of people arriving and another set leaving. The ONS says these main estimates provide “the only currently available data source that identifies when a student emigrates.” On the face of it, these suggest most immigrant students aren’t actually emigrating. In 2016, an estimated 588,000 people immigrated to the UK – that is, they intended to stay here for at least a year. Of those, 136,000 said the main reason they came was to study. At the same time, about 63,000 former student immigrants left the UK. We can’t just compare 136,000 to 63,000 here. They’re actually from slightly different sets of data, but more significantly they’re not the same people: those 63,000 people will have been immigrants from previous years. But that gap has been fairly consistent over the past few years. In every year since 2012 around 100,000 more student immigrants have arrived than former student emigrants have left. And each year the emigration of former students has accounted for less than half of student immigration. So what’s happening to these students if they’re not all emigrating? The ONS offers three main suggestions: Most student immigrants come from outside the EU on a temporary visa. They have the option to stay longer in the UK by extending their visa, either to continue study or move into a different category such as a work visa. In 2016, there were around 44,000 such extensions. That figure is falling rapidly: three years ago it was over 112,000. By comparison the number of non-EU immigrants coming to study was estimated at about 92,000 last year, and 122,000 three years ago. Again, those figures don’t cover the same group of people, so can’t be compared directly. Earlier this year, the Home Office also published figures tracking the journey of a group of immigrants who had arrived to the UK on a study visa in 2010 over several years. Of those issued a study visa in 2010, nearly half saw it expire within two years, showing that many will have been on short courses. After five years, only 19% still had valid leave to remain and 1% had indefinite leave to remain. That’s as far as these figures go – they don’t actually confirm what people do after their temporary visa expires. For obvious reasons, we don’t know a huge amount about how many students are overstaying their visas in the UK. Diane Abbott’s office pointed us to a Times report describing a leaked Home Office study which suggested that only a small minority of international students break the terms of their visa by staying in the UK after their course finishes. Without seeing more detail, it’s difficult to judge the accuracy of this report. The government says the work is “not completed”. These immigration figures cover students who say they intend to stay in the UK for at least a year – following the UN definition of who counts as an immigrant. That means some students aren’t counted here, for example those who come for a single year course: they arrive in September and leave the following summer. On the same basis, the emigration figures only cover students who intend to leave the UK for more than a year That means it’s possible that some students are slipping past these particular figures. This could be because they leave the UK within a year, or because they only end up leaving the UK temporarily. However, ONS analysis suggests that neither of these possible counting methods fully explains the gap between students immigrating to the UK and former students emigrating. The figure below shows recent work by the ONS – using data from 2015 in this case – to visualise all the possible things that could be happening to non-EU students who’ve previously immigrated to study here. ","The available evidence is contradictory. Most student immigrants come from outside the EU on a temporary visa and a minority still have the right to remain after a few years. But emigration figures suggest the number staying in the UK may be higher than this.

147,fullfact,"The UK gets more in EU research funding than it puts in.
","“Just in terms of research financing—I’m an academic—8.8 billion is what the UK has gotten from the European Union in the last five years, while they only contributed 5.4 billion. We have been net beneficiaries of the European Union.” Mariana Mazzucato, 24 November 2016 These figures appear to come from the Royal Society, an association of scientists. The thrust of the analysis seems right, although the UK is a net contributor to the wider EU budget. In other words, we get more out than we put in when it comes to science and technology, but pay in more than we get back overall. Dispensing with the pedantry first: these numbers are in euro rather than pounds, and cover a seven-year period (2007-2013) rather than five. €8.8 billion is what UK researchers saw in EU grants in that period, made up of €6.9 billion from the main EU funding programme for research and €1.9 billion from another pot of money. (We haven’t found the original source for this last figure, but as the equivalent for 2014-2020 is €1.6 billion, there’s little reason to doubt it.) By contrast, figures from the Treasury show that the UK’s “indicative contribution” to EU research coffers was £4.5 billion (€5.4 billion). So the UK was ahead of the game by a couple of billion. This may explain why many university leaders were strongly opposed to leaving the EU. The government has guaranteed to replace EU research funding, if necessary, in the next few years. But the question of participation in these programmes in the long term depends on negotiations with the 27 remaining members.  While non-EU countries are part of the research funding structure, there are potential difficulties with the UK becoming one of these associate members—including its status as a net beneficiary, which effectively reduces the money available to everyone else. We’ll have to see how negotiations pan out. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Correct, although the UK pays more into the EU budget overall than it gets out.

309,fullfact,"White, working-class boys are less likely than other groups to go on to university.
","If you’re a white, working-class boy, you’re less likely than anybody else in Britain to go to university. Theresa May, 13 July 2016 Less well-off white boys in England are, on average, less likely to attend university than minority ethnic groups, according to research done by the Institute for Fiscal Studies published last year. There’s no agreed upon definition of 'working class', and this research for England is the closest we've seen to answering this kind of question. This research refers to university enrolment in the academic years 2010/11 and 2011/12. While this was before before the increase in tuition fees, new data suggests white students' attendance has only fallen further behind since then.The lowest of any ethnic group  About 33% of white British school students enrolled in university in the academic years 2010/11 and 2011/12. That is the lowest enrolment rate of any ethnic group—next lowest is Black Caribbean students at 37%. By comparison the highest performing groups were Chinese students (76%), Indian students (67%) and Black African students (57%).  The IFS research is based on university enrollment prior to the 2012 tuition fees increase in England, so we don’t entirely know how different the picture looks now. Recent research suggests white British attendance has fallen since then. According to King's College London research, the total number of white first-year undergraduates fell by almost a third in 2012/13, the academic year following the rise. And the same paper concludes the effect of the tuition fees rise was smaller for minority ethnic groups.  There’s no agreed definition of what ‘working class’ means in this context. The IFS provides a useful breakdown of attendance by ‘socio-economic level’: a combination of student’s eligibility for free school meals and the average multiple deprivation figures for their local area.  What this shows is that of the least well-off fifth of white Britons, only 12 in 100 attended university. Of the next least well-off fifth, the number was 20 in 100. Both figures are lower than the equivalent band for any other ethnic minority.   A gender gap   The IFS report says that girls are on average 8% more likely than boys to attend university. This gender applies to white British students too: in 2010/11, 159,665 white girls enrolled in university, compared to 129,495 boys; the following year, the figures were 170,210 girls to 136,425 boys. This suggests white British boys from less well-off backgrounds are less likely to attend university than other groups.  There are some important caveats to the IFS research. Firstly, it excludes the six per cent of English students who, according to the Independent Schools Council, attended fee-paying schools in 2011. (The current figure is seven per cent.)   Secondly, it's based on English state-educated students who took their GCSEs in 2008 and enrolled at university either as 18 year olds in 2010 or 19 year olds the following academic year. In other words, it excludes those who started later or are yet to start.  ","This is correct for England, using research for university joiners in 2010 and 2011 and looking at the least well-off students.

310,fullfact,"There are record numbers of young people going to university, including from disadvantaged backgrounds.
","""…we have seen record numbers of young people entering higher education, including record numbers from disadvantaged backgrounds…"" Jo Johnson MP, Universities and Science Minister, 1 July 2015 We see this and similar claims coming up again and again. There are two different ways to look at undergraduate university entrants: the first is how many young people have been accepted for a place at university (UCAS data), the second is how many are there once they've started (government data). UCAS data shows record numbers and rates of 18 and 19 year olds going to university in England, including those from disadvantaged areas. The government data for first-time university attendance for 17-20 year olds isn't at a record high. But these figures are a year older than the UCAS ones (so may show a record high when they're updated), and the only year with a higher participation rate was 2011/12, when a higher proportion went to university before the increase in tuition fees a year later. Advantaged students are still substantially more likely to go to university. Record rate of young people accepted to university in England and Wales In 2015, there were 235,000 18 year olds accepted into a full-time place at university, the most ever recorded. If we want to look at whether young people are becoming more likely to go to university, the better measure is to look at whether the proportion of young people going to university has changed (which accounts for changes in the population). In 2015, 31% of 18 year olds in England were accepted into a university place (the entry rate)—an increase of almost one percentage point on the previous year and the highest level recorded. Entry rates for 18 year olds in Northern Ireland fell slightly in 2015. We haven't mentioned Scotland here because not all universities in Scotland use UCAS and data issues have affected comparability of the Scottish figures over time. While around half of all acceptances to university are 18 year olds, a further fifth are 19 year olds who have applied a year later. To account for this, UCAS provides a cohort entry rate, which measures how many of those in one year group get a place at university when they're 18 or 19.  The downside of this is that we don't yet have figures for 2015 because the most recent cohort hasn't yet had the chance to apply at 19. The cohort entry rates for England and Wales were all the highest on record in 2014. But, for Northern Ireland the cohort entry rate fell by just over one percentage point. Disadvantaged young people are more likely than ever before to enter higher education In 2015 the entry rate for 18 year olds living in the most disadvantaged areas was at a record high in England—around 19%—in Wales it has changed very little in comparison to 2014 and is still around 17%. But in Northern Ireland it has fallen very slightly to 16%. Disadvantage here is measured according to the rate of participation in higher education by young people in each area, so the most disadvantaged areas are those with the lowest rates of participation by young people. The rate for those in the most advantaged areas in 2015 was at a similar level to that seen in recent years—at 45% in England, 46% in Northern Ireland and 44% in Wales. The cohort entry rates (available only for England), show a decreasing gap between the likelihood of young people from the most disadvantaged areas of participation going to university and the likelihood of those from the most advantaged areas going to university. Those from the most advantaged areas are still significantly more likely to go to university though, with the gap in entry rates between the most and the least advantaged areas still at 35 percentage points. The other way to look at disadvantage is by income level, which UCAS measure by looking at whether or not a young person was receiving free school meals at age 15. The entry rate to university of 18 year old state school pupils in receipt of free school meals was also at a record high in 2015—a figure of 16%. That's compared to 31% for those who didn’t receive free school meals. Participation rate isn't yet at a record high The other way of looking at how many young people are going to university is by counting them once they're there (rather than when they're accepted for a place). The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills provides data on how many students from England who have been at university in the UK (or in a higher education course at college) for at least six months are aged 17-30 and at university for the first time. This data has the benefit of including part-timers, while the UCAS data relates only to full-time applicants. This is two years behind the UCAS data though, so its latest (provisional) figures measure the numbers of young people at university in autumn 2013 while the UCAS data looks at those given a place to start in autumn 2015. The participation rate of 17-20 year olds based on this data was still below the peak seen in 2011/12—a rate of 40% in 2013/14 compared to 41.5% in 2011/12. But 2011/12 saw particularly high participation because of people seeking to avoid the fee increase in 2012. Compared to the participation rate in 2010/11, the 2013/14 rate is higher. The release states that the participation rates for 2012/13 onwards signal a return to the trend before 2011/12 of year on year increases in the rate. Update 25 September 2015 We added in a sentence to explain that the participation rate seems to have returned to the trend of year-on-year increases seen before 2011/12. Update 1 August 2016 We have updated this piece to include the latest UCAS figures from 2015.","Accurate based on numbers and rates of young people accepted onto full-time places at university in England. Advantaged students are still substantially more likely to go to university.

66,fullfact,"Scrapping maintenance grants will price students from low income households out of university.
","""Many Students are going to be priced out of education if this grant is cut, many students will not be able to go, or be faced with enormous debt and will feel frightened of the huge lifetime loans."" 38 Degrees Petition It's A-Level results day, and all over the country licentious education editors are finding pictures of teenage girls jumping for joy to stick on their front page. However, not all students are flashing toothy grins at the cameraman. Next year's school-leavers will find no waiting maintenance grants. Instead, they'll find beefed up loans. Looking at English students living away from home and outside of London, while next year's students will have up to £550 more cash in their pockets in each year of study, they'll also graduate to find up to £12,500 more debt on their Student Finance statements. But because the government writes off student loan debts 30 years after graduation, most will end up paying no more because of the changes.  The people who will end up paying out more are students who came from lower income households and who go on to be in the top earning half of graduates. How student finance works now The government offers financial support for students to deal with tuition fees, and 'maintenance' (living expenses). Currently, maintenance funding is split over grants and loans. Total support offered to a student falls with increasing household income, and the composition of that support shifts from grants to loans. Full grants of £3,387 are given to students with a household income below £25,000, while students from households with incomes over £42,620 get no grant. They are, however, eligible for bigger maintenance loans. A student from a household with an income of £25,000 gets a loan of £4,047. If they came from a household earning just over £42,620, they'd be eligible for £5,740. The loan amount then falls again as household incomes rise. The changes mean low income students will get more help, but it will all be loans The summer budget replaced maintenance grants with beefed up loans worth up to £8,200. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) points out, students from low income households will have up to £550 more cash in their pockets each year than they would have if grants had just risen with prices. They'll also have rather more debt. Because all of this support will be in the form of loans, they'll graduate to find an extra £12,500 outstanding on their already slightly-scary-looking Student Finance statements. However, when it comes to student finance nothing is ever as straightforward as it seems. Just because you owe more, doesn't mean you'll pay more The government writes off student debts 30 years after graduation. Many students from lower income households will be protected by that write off. Exactly how many depends on whether you look at the change independently of other changes that were announced over the summer of 2015. Under the loan conditions in place before the summer, 65% of graduates who would have been given a full maintenance grant wouldn't have seen their repayments rise, as they wouldn't have paid off the lower loan, never mind a higher loan. The same applies to 62% of graduates who would have received a partial grant. The government has since frozen the level of earnings at which graduates have to start paying back their loans for at least five years. This means that graduates will have to start paying back their loans sooner than they would have done had the threshold increased with inflation. The impact this has on students who would’ve received the maintenance grant is that slightly more will end up paying more. The IFS told us that rather than 65% of graduates who would have been given a full maintenance grant not seeing their repayments rise, 59% won’t once the threshold freeze is taken into account. The rest of these graduates will see a rise in their total repayments. The group that are likely to make more repayments as a result of the changes are those who come from low to middle income households, and who will go on to be in the top earning half of graduates. Will the changes put off low income students? The application rate for students from disadvantaged areas rose after the 2012 reforms. However, as the IFS points out, that set of reforms saw students from low income households receive higher grants, and loan repayments for graduates with low incomes fell. The total effects of the latest set of reforms are confusing. The IFS argues that as repayments for some students from low income households are going to rise, this could put some off from going to university. However, increased funding at university might encourage students who would have found attending to be a financial strain. In addition, low-earning graduates will probably not see their repayments rise. As the IFS goes on to say, students coming from low income households are more likely to be low earning graduates, who are more likely to have some debt forgiven. There is an additional point to be made. While average repayments for students from low income households are set to rise, it will be people in the top half of graduate earners who make the additional repayments. In this sense, the people most likely to be discouraged are high ability potential students from low income households.  At the same time, these students might not be put off if they have few highly paid career options without the access granted by a degree. Update 1 March 2016 We updated the piece to incorporate the impact that the freezing of the earnings threshold has on students affected by the reform. This policy was introduced in autumn 2015, after a consultation on the proposed change. ","While at university they'll get more money than they did under the old system, and only students who go on to be high earners will pay back more.

311,fullfact,"Top universities make offers to 55% of white applicants, but only to 23% of black ones.
","""Some research has shown that top universities make offers to 55% of white applicants, but only to 23% of black ones. The reasons are complex, but unconscious bias is clearly a risk."" David Cameron, 26 October 2015 These figures are correct, according to research by an academic at Durham University, except they refer to applications rather than applicants. Applicants can make multiple applications, so it may be that the proportion of white and black applicants getting offers from top universities (in this case, the Russell Group) is different. As Mr Cameron says, the reasons for the difference are complex—just using these figures alone doesn't tell us if there is ""unconscious bias"", or conscious bias for that matter. For instance, ethnic minority applicants have been found to be more likely to apply for courses that are in high demand, and black applicants are predicted, and achieve, lower A level grades than white applicants. Research has had conflicting findings on whether black applicants (or ethnic minorities more generally) are still less likely to receive an offer once factors such as these are taken into account. Applications from white applicants are more likely to get an offer 55% of applications from white applicants for entry to Russell Group universities between 2010 and 2012 were offered a place.  That compares to 30% for applications from Black Caribbean applicants and 22% for Black African applicants—a combined average offer rate of about 23% (accounting for the comparative numbers of each in the study). Those statistics come from a study by Dr Vikki Boliver at Durham University and relate specifically to a sample of applications for full-time undergraduate courses by UK-domiciled applicants. Admissions tutors don't see the ethnicity of applicants, but Dr Boliver argues that they might infer an applicant's ethnicity based on things such as their name, address, schooling and personal statement. (As we looked at earlier this week, names do seem to be linked to success in job applications). External analysis of UCAS data found evidence of an ethnic bias Dr Boliver looked at whether ethnic minorities simply choosing more highly competitive degree subjects explained the lower offer rate. It explained some but not all of the difference in offer rates between applications from ethnic minority and white students with the same grades and 'facilitating subjects' at A level, according to her research. What she calls 'facilitating subjects' are ones identified by the Russell Group as being required most for access to its member universities. Dr Boliver said that inequality in offer rates for different ethnic groups was starker when ethnic minorities made up a larger proportion of applicants. The drawback to this analysis is that Dr Boliver says she couldn't access all UCAS data desired because of restrictions by UCAS on the use of personal data. So her analysis is based just on actual A level grades rather than predicted ones, which admissions tutors see alongside actual GCSE results. It also doesn't include the exact course applied for and the exact subjects required—only the general course area, such as 'Medicine and Dentistry' and these general facilitating subjects. UCAS's own analysis found no such evidence UCAS research—which looks specifically at applications by 18 year olds applying to UCAS for the first time and to universities with higher requirements—found there was little evidence of ethnic bias in university acceptance rates, after taking into account applicants' predicted A level grades and the popularity of the course and institution applied for. UCAS said that actual offer rates for applications by Asian, black, mixed and other applicants were close to what would be expected based on the predicted grades they hold and the courses they apply to. It said that ""most of the difference"" in actual offer rates between ethnic groups was accounted for by ethnic minority applicants applying for more competitive universities and courses. Dr Boliver has said this research is ""far from conclusive"" as it excludes applicants to Oxbridge, medicine and applicants predicted three A*s. UCAS said it excluded these particular applicants because it felt they wouldn't offer a like for like comparison—for example, because Oxbridge and medicine applications involve interviews too. It has said it will publish further analysis on these applicants when it's complete. Dr Boliver also said that UCAS hasn't released enough data for other researchers to verify or challenge UCAS's claims—UCAS says it has. Entry rates for black and ethnic groups have been increasing since 2006 UCAS pointed us to its figures on entry rates too which show entry rates for 18 year old state school pupils in England from black and ethnic groups increasing since 2006—with black pupils seeing the largest increase. Entry rates for state school pupils are lowest among white pupils.","These figures are correct, according to research looking at offers made by Russell Group universities, although they relate to applications rather than applicants. The reasons for the difference are complex - research has had conflicting findings on whether there is underlying discrimination.

67,fullfact,"Black workers face a widening pay gap the more qualifications they earn. 
","""Black workers ‘face widening pay gap the more qualifications they earn’"" The Independent, 1 February 2016 Similar claims have been made by the BBC and the Guardian.  They’re based on analysis of pay data by the Trades Union Congress (TUC).  The analysis found that the more qualified black workers were, the further their earnings lagged behind those of white workers with the same level of qualifications. What this analysis can’t tell us is why that’s the case. Nor does it mean that this will be the experience that individual workers have—it tells us what the gap looks like overall.  More in-depth research from academics suggests that a substantial part of the gap can be explained by differences in the types of jobs black workers go into. Black and ethnic minorities are more likely to work in industries or occupations that pay less.   And the type of degree matters too. The TUC’s analysis is comparing the salaries of all graduates, without factoring in things like which university they studied at, what subject was studied, and what grade was achieved. Wage comparison The TUC’s analysis compares the average hourly pay of employees from October-December 2014 to July-September 2015. It compares workers identifying as black African, black Caribbean or black British with workers identifying as white (including white British and white Irish among others), finding that black workers with degrees earn a quarter less than white workers with degrees. The difference it found for black workers ranged from 11% lower wages for workers with A*-C grade GCSE or equivalent, to a 14% difference for workers with A-levels, increasing to 23% among those with degrees. On average black workers earned 13% less than white workers. The wages measure that it uses includes bonuses. This may or may not be significant. It is when it comes to the gender pay gap—as men work relatively more overtime than women. We don’t know if there’s a difference here between ethnic groups. It also looks at employees specifically, as does the academic research, so it’ll exclude people who are self-employed, for example. Analysis doesn’t account for differences such as in grades or subjects Differences in grades at each level of qualification and the subjects being studied isn’t taken into account here. Research published last month by academics at the University of Essex suggests this makes a difference. It found that 13% of white British students graduate with a first-class degree, while only 5% of Black students do. Black African and black Caribbean students also graduate on average from less prestigious universities than their white British peers, according to the research. Accounting for these aspects, as well as other characteristics such as family background, age and gender, tells us more about why there’s a gap in earnings. For instance the research found that among black Caribbean and black African graduates, your socio-economic background and your local network play a significant role in whether you’ll earn less than your white British counterparts. So too do your early experiences in the labour market. The research found that ethnic minority graduates were less likely to be employed six months after graduation, even adjusting for things like their background and the qualifications they obtained. That difference had long-lasting effects on wages. Ethnic minorities end up in lower paid occupations The pay gap can take two forms, another University of Essex report on this topic argues. A pay gap can either emerge from ethnic minorities entering less well paid occupations than their peers despite having similar qualifications, or it can emerge from ethnic minorities being paid less for the same occupation to their peers. For the former, differences may occur due to bias against entry into an occupation or bias against promotion into higher-level occupations, it argues. The research, which looks at the period 1993 to 2008, found that a substantial part of the ethnic wage gap was due to the first type of pay gap—so differences in the types of jobs that ethnic minorities are in compared to their peers. Once the occupation type is accounted for, alongside other characteristics such as age and education level, black workers still earn less than their white British peers, but the gap is smaller.  ","There’s evidence of an overall pay gap, but the relationship between qualifications and pay is complicated. The claim is based on analysis comparing the average earnings of black and white workers over an annual period. It doesn’t take account of things like the grades obtained in each qualification, where graduates have studied and what types of jobs they end up in. Nor does it mean that this will be the experience that individual workers have—it tells us what the gap looks like overall.

68,fullfact,"People with white-sounding names are nearly twice as likely to get call backs for jobs than people with ethnic sounding names.
","Do you know that in our country today: even if they have exactly the same qualifications, people with white-sounding names are nearly twice as likely to get call backs for jobs than people with ethnic-sounding names? David Cameron, 7 October 2015 Job applications in British cities from people with white sounding names were 74% more likely to receive a positive response than applications from people with an ethnic minority name. That's according to 2009 research from NatCen Social Research, commissioned by the government. The findings relate specifically to job applications so don't tell us about interviews or about discrimination in the workplace once someone has a job. We've asked the Prime Minister's Office to confirm if this is the research behind his claim and we're waiting for it to get back to us. Discrimination much more likely in CV-based applications Of 987 applications with a white name, 10.7% received a positive response compared to 6.2% of the 1,974 applications with an ethnic minority name—making applications from white sounding names 74% more likely to have some success. At a stretch that can be read as being ""nearly twice"" as likely to get a positive response. Three applications were sent to each job vacancy among nearly 1,000 vacancies. Ethnic identity was randomly assigned to each of the three applications using names widely associated with ethnic groups—one out of three was given a white name and the other two were given names from different minority ethnic groups. Each of the three applications were ""closely matched"" in terms of their education, skills and work history. A positive response counted as either being called back to an interview, or some other form of positive response such as being asked for information on the amount of money you'd expect to be paid. There was no significant difference in discrimination between ethnic minority groups or between areas. The level of net discrimination—the proportion of ethnic minority applications receiving a positive response from employers subtracted from the proportion of white applications receiving a positive response—in favour of white names over equivalent applications from ethnic minority candidates was 29%. Applications made using the employer's own form showed virtually no net discrimination (1%), compared to 38% where a CV had been sent. The study said this may be due to employer forms having a detachable section with personal details, which could be removed before the sifting process. Lower levels of discrimination in the public sector could be due to greater use of employer forms, the study said. The recession may have influenced the level of discrimination The likelihood of getting positive responses to the applications may have been affected by the timing of the study, which took place during the recession. The study says that one or more of the three applications to a particular vacancy received a positive response in 16% of the jobs applied for. This may have influenced the level of discrimination, ""with some employers able to pick and choose applicants to a greater degree"", the report said. Applications were also less successful in some occupations, which the report said could be due to being less good at mimicking a good application in some sectors.","In a 2009 experimental study, 10.7% of applicants with a white sounding name received a positive response, compared with 6.2% of applicants with an ethnic minority sounding name - making them 74% more likely to get a positive response.

312,fullfact,"Funding for some early help services in England has fallen by £1.8 billion from 2010 to 2015
","""Research suggests that government funding for a range of early help services in England fell from £3.2bn in 2010 to £1.4bn in 2015.""—BBC News, 7 July 2015 Earlier this month a number of charities released research suggesting a £1.8 billion fall in government funding for some ""early intervention services"" for children and young people. In response, the government has said that funding for the services has actually increased. It seems likely that the difference in figures is down to different definitions of what is meant by 'early intervention'. The charities' research itself looked at two different definitions. The press-released figures—showing a fall from £3.2 billion to £1.4 billion—show the biggest drop. But these numbers are only for those services where funding is allocated directly to local authorities in England with the stated purpose being 'early intervention'. When the researchers include other services allocated through the Department for Education (DfE), the fall in funding between 2010 and 2015 smaller, from £3.3 billion to £2.4 billion. We've asked the government to tell us what it's counting as 'early intervention', in order to get to its stated rise in funding. Two estimates of early intervention cuts The research on 'early intervention' funding is by Children & Young People Now, The Children's Society, and the National Children's Bureau (NCB). In the report, early intervention services are defined to include information and advice for young people, respite care for families with disabled children, and children's centres. Central government funding for these services used to go primarily through a direct grant to Local Authorities called the 'Early Intervention Grant' but from 2013/14 the money from this pot was 'rolled in' to a wider budget for Local Authorities. Since then the Department for Communities and Local Government has indicated how much of that total funding is for early intervention services, and the researchers have compared this to the Early Intervention Grants to come up with the fall in funding for Early Intervention services as given in direct funding to Local Authorities. They calculate it's fallen from £3.3 billion in 2010/11 as set out in the March 2010 budget, to £2.8 billion in the same year as set out in June 2010 (the Coalition's first budget). By 2015/16 it had fallen to £1.5 billion. That, remember, is only the money allocated directly to Local Authorities for the services. When the researchers included money from the DfE's allocation spending the drop in funding looked quite different.  The DfE spending includes money for early education for disadvantaged two year-olds, which it became responsible for in 2013, alongside some other early intervention services. The early education scheme used to be part of the Early Intervention Grant. Including this money, the report calculates that overall funding for early interventions has been reduced from £3.3 billion to £2.4 billion. These are the figures it says should be used to represent overall spending on early intervention.","Research by charities backs this up but only counts funding allocated directly to local authorities. Counting other funding can show a smaller fall.

313,fullfact,"58.8% of graduates are in non-graduate jobs. 
","""58.8 per cent of UK graduates have ended up in non-graduate jobs…"" The Independent, 19 August 2015 58.8% of UK graduates have ended up in non-graduate jobs, according to several outlets. But the Chief Executive of Universities UK disputes this figure. With the new academic year fast approaching, we've taken a look. The figure is based on graduates' responses to a 2010 survey, which asked how many years of education someone else would need to apply for their job. More recent figures, from the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), show that in the second quarter of 2015, 66.4% of working age graduates in England were in high skilled jobs. That excludes those with qualifications higher than a graduate degree—78.6% of postgraduates had a high skilled job. The 58.8 % figure comes from a five year old survey The 58.8% figure comes from a report published by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), in which they report on their own analysis of the European Social Survey (ESS). The survey is from 2010, which probably wasn't a typical year for graduates; unemployment was higher and graduates may have been more likely to ""settle"" for a less suitable role. So it may not be a good reflection of experiences in 2015. Unfortunately, there's no more recent set of data from the ESS on this topic. It uses a subjective definition of a graduate job The ESS didn't ask people whether they were in a graduate job. Instead, it asked people how many years of education (beyond compulsory education) someone would need in order to apply for their current job. The CIPD conducted its own analysis of this data, creating its own definition of a graduate job: a job which the post-holder believes requires an applicant to have 15-16 years of education in total. They say that this represents the number of years of education someone would typically have after completing an undergraduate degree course. So there's an element of subjectivity there—if for some reason graduates were likely to underestimate the skills needed in their job that would mean more of them would appear in the survey as having non-graduate roles. The opposite is equally possible, of course. Other sources suggest that fewer graduates are in a non-graduate job While there are no official figures for ""graduate jobs"", there is one for ""high skilled jobs"" and these are sometimes used interchangeably. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills estimates that in the second quarter of 2015 66.4% of working age graduates in England (which excludes those with qualifications higher than a graduate degree) were in high skilled jobs, and that 3.0% were unemployed. From the figures we can deduce that the highest possible proportion of all working age graduates that aren't in a high skilled job is 30.6%. Update 8 September 2015 This article has been updated with new graduate labour market statistics published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.","This figure is based on a survey from 2010. Separate figures from earlier this year paint a different picture.

In Scotland it is 3.5 times. So what we are seeing here is that the policy of free tuition has not had the desired result."" Merryn Somerset Webb, 11 May 2017 There are two ways to look at this that we’re aware of, both of which focus on 18 year olds.  There are also some flaws with UCAS’ data on Scottish education, which means that comparisons with England should be done cautiously. We’ve written more about that here.  The claim is pretty much correct when it comes to how many students have been offered a university place from a particular group.  UCAS university entry rates for 18 year olds in the most advantaged areas in Scotland were 3.5 times that of young people in the most disadvantaged areas in 2016, while in England young people in the most advantaged areas were 2.4 times as likely to attend university.  The claim is incorrect when it comes to application rates—how many people apply to university from a particular group and what Ms Somerset Webb appears to be referring to in the claim. Ms Somerset Webb is getting back to us to confirm what evidence she was referring to. The 2017 university application rate of 18 year olds living in the most advantaged areas in England was about 2.3 times that of students in the most disadvantaged areas.  In Scotland, students in the most advantaged areas were about 2.6 times as likely to apply to university in 2017 than those in the most disadvantaged areas. Removing tuition fees in Scotland doesn’t seem to have “given Scotland any specific advantage...in relation to increasing overall levels of participation or participation by more disadvantaged groups”, says the Sutton Trust. It said increased competition for places, due to not having enough university places to meet demand, has had a particularly bad effect on students from the most deprived backgrounds.  This is specifically in relation to university access. A substantial number of disadvantaged students study higher education in colleges in Scotland, and aren’t reflected in these figures, which is one of the reasons why comparing university access in Scotland and England is tricky.    This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Incorrect if you are looking at university application rates but pretty much correct for 2016 university entry rates (both focused on 18 year olds). Some care needs to be taken over these comparisons because of differences between higher education data in Scotland and England.

315,fullfact,"You are twice as likely to get into university if you are poor and English as if you are poor and Scottish.
","“You are twice as likely to get into university if you are poor and English than if you are poor and Scottish."" Fraser Nelson, 9 March 2017 In last week’s BBC Question Time Fraser Nelson claimed that there was a huge gap between the rich and the poor in Scottish education. His previous articles on this issue have used UCAS data so that’s what we have looked at. There are some flaws with UCAS’ data on Scottish education. This means that comparisons with England should be done cautiously. However, we can roughly say that 18 year olds living in the least advantaged areas in England are about twice as likely to go to university as 18 year olds in the least advantaged areas in Scotland, based on UCAS figures.  This doesn’t mean that this is the case for higher education more generally, because this excludes a significant number of students in Scotland who study higher education in colleges. UCAS uses a measure called POLAR3 to measure disadvantage, which ranks small areas in the UK according to how many people living in that area are in higher education by the age of 19. There are five different groups. Each group contains about 20% of young people in the UK. According to this measure, nearly twice as many 18 year olds in the least advantaged areas in England got a place at university—19.5% compared to only 10.7% of their Scottish counterparts in 2016. Using POLAR3 isn’t ideal to check claims about poverty. The Higher Education Funding Council for England, which produces the measure, notes that POLAR3 is only a measure of educational disadvantage relating to participation in higher education, and “is not necessarily an appropriate substitute for other measures of disadvantage”.  And there’s another problem with this comparison. This is a flawed comparison according to UCAS. Far fewer young people live in the areas defined as least advantaged by POLAR3 in Scotland as do in England (relative to the total number of young people in each nation). This tends to push down the entry rate for these areas in Scotland, making it hard to single out the effect of being disadvantaged. To be more confident in our comparison, and to focus more on poverty, UCAS suggested another option is to look at the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). Like POLAR3, this ranks local areas into five different groups. But unlike POLAR3 there aren’t fewer Scottish young people in the areas defined as “least advantaged”. The SIMD also looks at more things than just education, such as income and health. This measure paints a similar picture. 10.9% of Scottish 18 year olds in the least advantaged areas by the SIMD measure got offered a higher education place in 2016. So that's roughly the same proportion as the POLAR3 measure for Scotland. And UCAS said it was likely that the equivalent measure for England would be at least twice that (but that more research would be needed to map them over exactly). So UCAS said on this basis, it’s reasonable to say that the least advantaged 20% of 18 year olds in Scotland seem roughly half as likely to get into university, even if we're not directly comparing like-with-like. We’ve been talking about “higher education” entry rates but these figures actually exclude a substantial part of the Scottish higher education system. About one third of young full time undergraduate study is provided by further education colleges in Scotland. Many of these Scottish colleges do not use the centralised UCAS system and so don’t provide information for UCAS to include in their entry rates. So in Scotland there is “a substantial section of provision that is not included in UCAS' figures”. This means that we can use the UCAS figures to roughly compare entry to university between Scotland and England (since UCAS told us most of the provision in England is in universities), but they don’t provide the full story about educational disparity in Scotland. Young people may not be going to university as much in Scotland but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they aren’t studying to a higher level of education. Scotland actually has a relatively high overall participation rate in higher education in UK terms.

316,fullfact,"Students from a deprived background in Scotland are half as likely to go to university as those from England.
","“In Scotland if you’re from a deprived background you’re half as likely to get into university as you are in England.” Fraser Nelson, 5 October 2017 It’s roughly correct to say that 18 year olds from the most disadvantaged areas in Scotland are about half as likely to go to university as 18 year olds from the most disadvantaged areas in England. There are some problems with the way this is measured though which makes the comparison tricky. About 10.7% of 18 year olds from disadvantaged backgrounds in Scotland went into full-time undergraduate courses compared to 19.5% in England in 2016. Disadvantage here is measured by how many people in the local area a student comes from go to university, rather than other forms of disadvantage.  First, fewer people live in the most disadvantaged areas in Scotland than those in England, which make comparing them tricky. Having said that, UCAS told us that measuring disadvantage in Scotland in other ways it is reasonable to say that students are about half as likely to go to university as their English counterparts. Though this isn’t measuring disadvantage in the two countries in the same way. Secondly, around one third of young full-time undergraduate courses in Scotland are studied at higher education colleges, rather than universities. Many of these colleges don’t use the UCAS system so aren’t counted here. Students from the most deprived areas in Scotland are also overrepresented in these higher education colleges. While we can use the UCAS figures to tell us roughly about the likelihood of young Scottish students from disadvantaged areas going to university compared to those in England, they don’t give us the full picture on those doing undergraduate degrees. We’ve written about this in more detail here. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","This is probably a reasonable claim, though the comparison is a bit tricky. It also doesn’t account for the substantial amount of higher education provided by further education colleges in Scotland.

","“We’ve seen, statistics have shown, that the higher tuition fees haven’t really put people, students from disadvantaged backgrounds, [off] from going into university either.” Dia Chakravarty, 21 September 2017 The 2012 increase in tuition fees doesn’t seem to have affected the long-term trend of growing proportions of young people—including from disadvantaged backgrounds—applying or going to university. It is harder to say what the impact is for mature students—the Office for Fair Access says that the evidence is mixed. Looking at several different measures, the proportion of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds applying and going to university in England is at a record high. Some of these measures do show a slightly slower increase in the past year or two. We’ve got more detail on this and other areas of the UK in this article.

318,fullfact,"Many graduates will not pay back their student debt.
","“But in reality, the actual debts that have totalled up for those graduates, and to get them, is impossible. More than that, many of them are not paying it and won't pay it, so you’ve really got to ask yourselves, was it worthwhile?” John Prescott, 22 February 2018 “It's approximately 15% of people will pay back their entire student loan.” BBC Question Time audience member, 22 February 2018 These claims are correct—the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that around 83% of graduates will have some debt written off under the current system. So around 17% are expected to repay in full. The government announced this week it is going to conduct a major review into post-16 education, including university funding. In 2012 the Coalition government raised the cap on tuition fees for undergraduate courses from around £3,500 to £6,000 for all universities, and to £9,000 in ""exceptional circumstances"". This increased to £9,250 in 2017/18, which now the majority of universities are charging at or near. The 2012 reforms were broadly intended to shift more of the burden of payment away from public funding and onto graduates, improve student choice, and to set up a more progressive loan structure so that lower earning graduates would pay less. A raft of changes have taken place since then which have both pushed up and down the amounts that graduates end up re-paying. These include the replacement of maintenance grants with loans—policies which have increased the debts of the lowest income students—and more recently the raising of the earnings level at which graduates have to start repaying their debts from £21,000 to £25,000. The average debt for students starting their degree is now just under £50,000, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. This is more than double the average debt under the 2011 system. It’s correct that many students won’t pay off this debt—the IFS estimates that around 83% of graduates will have some debt written off under the current system. So around 17% are expected to repay in full. The latest estimate from the IFS is that the taxpayer may end up paying for around 45% of the loans of students starting in 2017. The increase in the earnings threshold pushed this up from about 31%. Both of these estimates are uncertain and affected by things like future interest rates and changes in the jobs market. So was the 2012 fee increase worthwhile? There are lots of different elements to consider and we’re not going to go into all of them here. When it comes to the cost to the taxpayer, the 2012 system always expected that a certain amount of debt wouldn’t be repaid, but not as much as is currently forecast (though we're checking if the forecasts are comparable). When the 2012 reforms were proposed, the government estimated that it would bear the cost of around 30% of student debt, which it said would “maintain progressive elements of the scheme”.  The IFS has said “the main beneficiaries from reducing fees would be high-earning graduates, as they are the ones making the highest repayments under the current system”. Check out the House of Commons Library briefings and the Institute for Fiscal Studies if you want to find out more. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time.

The average debt for students starting their degree is now just under £50,000, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. This is more than double the average debt under the 2011 system. It’s correct that many students won’t pay off this debt—the IFS estimates that around 83% of graduates will have some debt written off under the current system. So around 17% are expected to repay in full. The latest estimate from the IFS is that the taxpayer may end up paying for around 45% of the loans of students starting in 2017. The increase in the earnings threshold pushed this up from about 31%. Both of these estimates are uncertain and affected by things like future interest rates and changes in the jobs market. So was the 2012 fee increase worthwhile? There are lots of different elements to consider and we’re not going to go into all of them here. When it comes to the cost to the taxpayer, the 2012 system always expected that a certain amount of debt wouldn’t be repaid, but not as much as is currently forecast (though we're checking if the forecasts are comparable). When the 2012 reforms were proposed, the government estimated that it would bear the cost of around 30% of student debt, which it said would “maintain progressive elements of the scheme”.  The IFS has said “the main beneficiaries from reducing fees would be high-earning graduates, as they are the ones making the highest repayments under the current system”.

Educational attainment in Scotland is at record levels.
","Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh MP: “We have record levels of attainment in Scotland.” Kezia Dugdale MSP: “That’s not true.” Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh MP: “93.3% of young people are going to into education, training or employment when they leave school.” Kezia Dugdale MSP: “That's destinations not attainment.” BBC Question Time, 9 March 2017 Both politicians seem to be talking past each other. They’re correctly referencing different sets of figures, but it’s less clear what Ms Ahmed-Sheikh means by record levels of attainment, since she goes on to talk about where pupils go after they leave school. Labour confirmed Ms Dugdale was talking about Scotland’s recent performance in the PISA international survey of 15 year-olds’ educational performance. The survey showed Scotland’s performance in science and reading falling between 2012 and 2015.   While performance in maths hadn’t changed much in that time, it was still lower than scores back in the mid-2000s. Ms Ahmed-Sheikh appeared to be backing up her claim about attainment with statistics about the destination of school leavers, which is different. It’s possible that she was making a separate point on attainment without going into detail, so we’ve asked her office to confirm what her initial claim referred to. On destinations, she’s correct that, using the available figures, a record proportion of young people are going into education, employment or training. In 2015/16, 93.3% of school leavers in Scotland went into higher or further education, paid or unpaid work, training and ‘activity agreements’. That’s been rising each year, from 90.1% in 2011/12. Those figures tell us what’s happening to former pupils three months after leaving. There’s usually a follow-up survey after nine months, which tends to show a small drop in pupils going into education, work or training. One other measure of attainment paints a more positive picture, in line with Ms Ahmed-Sheikh’s initial claim. The proportion of school leavers in Scotland attaining one or more Higher qualification has been rising since 2006, from just over 40% to around 60%. At the other end of the spectrum there’s a rising proportion of pupils leaving without any passes at level 3 or better. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time.

346,fullfact,"In Scottish education, bright children from poor areas are two years behind their better-off peers.
","“If you are a bright child living in a poorer area in Scotland, you are two years behind the same child living in a more affluent area.” David Mundell, 16 February 2017 This more or less reflects the findings of a recent study by the Sutton Trust, which the Scotland Office confirmed is the source of the claim.  It’s actually referring to the family economic background of the children, rather than the area they live in, and it specifically relates to 15 year olds. Different measures may well show different results. High-achieving well-off pupils in Scotland perform better at science, reading and maths than high-achieving poor pupils, according to the research. It analysed data from 2015 from the PISA international survey of 15 year olds’ educational performance. The survey specifically seeks to test children’s “functional ability”, so how well they can use their science, maths, and reading skills in “real life” situations. The gap in test scores between the two groups was translated as 31 months for science and maths, and 26 months for reading. So poorer pupils were somewhere between two and three years ‘behind’ their better-off peers, according to the research. That’s actually a slightly smaller gap than is the case in England and compared to the average of the mainly wealthy countries covered by the PISA figures. There are many variables in play to produce this kind of estimate. You need to choose who counts as rich and who counts as poor. You need to choose who counts as a high-achiever. You need to be happy that the test scores are an accurate reflection of ability. And you need to assume, based on those test scores, how far ‘behind’ one pupil is from another. For instance, the measure of deprivation used in this report isn’t the same measure that’s commonly used in Scotland. It compares the 25% most deprived pupils with the 25% least deprived, based on ranking them by their background via a questionnaire. The measure used in Scotland identifies small geographic areas of deprivation based on a range of different factors like health and people’s incomes. Another assumption is that a difference of about 30 points on PISA tests is equivalent to about a year’s attainment. That’s how we get from test scores to a claim about how far behind some children are to others. This isn’t a precise science, and previous years’ surveys actually said 40 points was equivalent to a year. A final note of caution is with PISA figures themselves. They’re based on a sample of 15 year olds, so there’s some uncertainty in the figures. They also don’t tell us why some countries, schools or pupils perform better than others. None of this is to say the headline claim is a bad estimate, especially if you agree with the choices the research has made on these questions. But it’s because of this uncertainty that we can’t say the findings are definitive. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","15 year-olds from poorer families in Scotland were found to be roughly 2-3 years behind their better off peers in recent research comparing performance in science, maths and reading. That’s one of many ways to measure the attainment gap, so this answer isn’t definitive.

","“In ten years half a million fewer males have gone to university than females.” Karl McCartney MP, 18 January 2017 We asked Mr McCartney’s office who said that he was referring to the difference in the number of UK-based men and women accepted to UK universities from 2007 to 2016. There were 489,000 fewer men than women accepted to undergraduate courses during this time. Just under 2.4 million women living in the UK were accepted to university over the last ten years compared to 1.9 million men. Looking at all students, no matter where they lived when they applied, there were 516,000 more women than men accepted over the last ten years. If you look at the proportion of applications which resulted in an acceptance then the two groups are roughly similar. 75% of applications resulted in acceptances for women living in the UK compared to 79% for men since 2007. It’s worth remembering that these figures aren’t complete as they only cover around two thirds of Scottish applicants to higher education colleges.

236,fullfact,"A ""cracked"" trial is one that's dropped because a witness doesn't turn up or withdraws their evidence.
","“HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate... found a rising number of prosecutions were ""cracked""—which is the term used for a case that closes unexpectedly because a witness is absent or has withdrawn evidence."" BBC News, 19 January 2016 This isn’t quite right. A criminal trial can be ‘cracked’, or be closed unexpectedly, for reasons that have nothing to do with witnesses. A trial will generally be deemed to have “cracked” where a trial date has been set but the defendant pleads guilty on the day, or the prosecution has no evidence to give. This means that the case is resolved without a trial. But lawyers, judges and witnesses will have prepared for one and booked in the necessary court time—so it’s not an efficient outcome. Cracked trials are a problem. The agency that inspects prosecutors released a report today focusing on witnesses and their role in cracked trials. That may explain why the BBC report defines a cracked trial as something caused by witnesses, when in fact late guilty pleas are the main culprit. In 2014/15 one in five of all criminal trials in England and Wales were cracked for this reason. “The [inspectorate's] report said that 2.1% of trials in the crown court and 6.8% of trials in the magistrates' court were ‘cracked’ in 2014-15, compared with 1.8% and 6.3% respectively the previous year.” This might cause confusion. About 35% of trials in the crown court and 37% in the magistrates’ court were cracked in 2014/15. The inspectors’ report said that 2.1% and 6.8% of trials were cracked because a witness didn’t give evidence—a rise on the previous year. The overall level of cracked trials has actually fallen recently, particularly in the crown court where more serious cases happen. Five years ago, 42% of scheduled crown court cases finished without a trial, compared to 37% last year. The proportion of trials that are ‘ineffective’, or have to be rescheduled at some point, has also dropped. But the Justice Secretary, Michael Gove, has called for improvement. In particular, he points to problems with court administration, which are accounting for an increasing share of delayed cases.","A criminal trial can be ""cracked"", or closed unexpectedly, for lots of reasons.

237,fullfact,"More than half of criminal trials in England and Wales have to rescheduled or called of.
","""Across both magistrates and Crown Courts, almost 1 in 5 trials—17%—are ""ineffective""—meaning the required court hearing does not happen on the day, often due to administrative issues, and needs to be rearranged. Almost 2 in 5 trials—37%—are ""cracked""—meaning the case concludes unexpectedly without a planned court hearing. Last year, there were more than 33,000 ineffective trials in our criminal courts. That leaves less than half of cases—46%—which are ""effective"". We must do better.""—Michael Gove, 23 June 2015 One thing that both Michael Gove and the criminal lawyers protesting against his Ministry of Justice agree on is that the courts are under pressure. When it comes to the number of criminal trials in England and Wales that are rearranged or don't go ahead after being scheduled, the minister's figures are spot on. Interestingly, though, the numbers might lead you to think that things have actually improved over the past ten years or so. In the Magistrates' Court, where most trials take place, 18% of trials were ""ineffective"" last year—meaning that they didn't go ahead on the planned date. That's down from 29% in 2003, according to Ministry of Justice statistics. The proportion of effective trials—those that weren't delayed or called off unexpectedly—has risen from a third of the total to 45%.  In the Crown Court, where more serious cases are held, the rate of effective trials has also improved slightly. But look a bit deeper, and it's easier to see the reason for Mr Gove's concerns. Trials can be ineffective for many reasons, not all of which are down to systemic error. If a defendant on bail doesn't turn up to a Crown Court trial, for example, it will be delayed until he or she is tracked down. The proportion of ineffective trials that are put down to problems with court administration has been rising. This is now the reason for an ineffective trial in almost three in 10 cases, although part of the reason for this is that other causes of delay have improved.  Looking at the proportion of all criminal trials that are ineffective due to administrative problems, the rate has increased from 3.7% in 2007 to almost 5% in 2014. Mr Gove says that he wants to implement the recommendations made by Sir Brian Leveson, a senior judge, in his review of the efficiency of criminal proceedings. The last government announced a package of £375 million of investment to modernise the ""ageing"" court infrastructure.","Correct.

238,fullfact,"One third of those who have won a case against the UK at the European human right court were terrorists, criminals or prisoners. 
","""A third of those who have won against Britain at the European Court of Human Rights are terrorists, prisoners or criminals, figures show."" The Sun, 15 August 2015 Terrorists, criminals and prisoners are people too, at least in the eyes of human rights law. Anyone can apply to the European Court of Human Rights for a declaration that their rights have been breached; what they might have done in the past isn't relevant to whether or not they have a case. The figure of one third of those successful at the Court being a criminal, terrorist or prisoner comes from the human rights organisation RightsInfo. It says that of the 297 judgments where the Court has found that the British government had violated someone's rights, 203 haven't involved anyone of that background. We make that figure 150—so just under half the cases involved someone convicted or suspected of a criminal offence. But the answer very much depends on what you mean by ""criminal"". Who counts as a criminal? In the chart below, we define criminals or suspects widely. We've included anyone who's ever been convicted of a criminal offence, according to the Court's judgment in their human rights case. This includes terrorism suspects with prior convictions, a man hit with financial penalties for non-payment of tax and a woman cautioned for abducting her grandson.    RightsInfo, as we can see from the source data it helpfully publishes, doesn't include cases like these in its list of ""terrorists"", ""criminals"" and ""prisoners"". More fundamentally, it excludes around 30 other cases where it's not in dispute that the applicant committed a criminal offence. This is because the case wasn't about their status as a criminal, or because the Court went on to find a problem with their conviction under article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This protects the right to a fair trial. You would expect to find people convicted of a crime, in circumstances they consider unfair, to rely on this article before the Court. In that sense, ""criminals"" applying to the Court is what's supposed to happen.    This choice not to count some people convicted of offences as ""criminals"" accounts for most of the differences in our figures: we've included every mention of past criminality, whether or not it was relevant to the case or deemed a human rights violation by the Court. RightsInfo told us that ""it makes more sense to exclude those claims from the 'criminal' category where the fact of the criminal conviction is irrelevant to the nature of the claim"". Instead, it deems a person ""criminal"" only where their criminal status was central to the case, but the court's finding of a human rights violation didn't affect their status as a criminal. No hard and fast rules on who counts as a ""criminal"", but criminal conviction the easiest guide If by ""criminal"" you mean anyone who has ever committed a criminal offence, and you want to know how many of those people have ever won at the European Court of Human Rights, then our chart answers your question. If you think not everyone convicted of an offence should be labelled as a ""criminal"", you'll prefer RightsInfo's more selective approach. But you can run into problems when you start to pick and choose among people with a criminal record who you call a ""criminal"" and who you don't. This leads to inconsistencies, as well as conclusions that seem at odds with common understandings of the term. Hard cases Take the case of a man convicted of importing heroin, who we've categorised as a ""criminal"". The Court found that his right to privacy had been breached by unlawful surveillance used at his trial, although it didn't affect the fairness of the conviction. RightsInfo says he counts as a non-criminal ""other person"" because the Court's decision wasn't about his status as a criminal: he could have won his human rights case even if found not guilty. RightsInfo labels the child killers of James Bulger as ""criminals"", whereas Raphael Rowe and Michael Davis are ""other people"". In both cases, the people involved had been convicted of murder at the time they applied to the Court, which in both cases found the same thing: that the applicants' right to a fair trial had been breached. (The murder convictions of Mr Rowe and Mr Davis were, in addition, subsequently quashed by the Court of Appeal back in England.) These kinds of difficulties are why we've gone for a more black-and-white approach. There's no perfect numerical answer to the question of criminals winning cases against the British government at the European Court of Human Rights. What we can say is that in assessing the proportion connected to criminality, half represents the highest reasonable figure, and one third the lowest possible. Update 11 September 2015 We added that some cases won by ""criminals"" concern the right to a fair trial, the existence of which means that some cases heard by the Court will invariably involve people convicted of a criminal offence.","Around half of successful cases involved someone convicted or suspected of a criminal offence at some point. The answer depends on how you define ""criminal"".

7,fullfact,"A decision of the European Court of Human Rights means that the police have to warn criminals about serious threats to their life.
","“Euro judges order police to ‘protect’ gangsters: Officers forced to issue ‘threat to life notices’ to villains and drug lords” Daily Mail, 30 September 2016 It’s correct that the police issue ‘threat to life warnings’ to people at serious risk of being killed, including people suspected of being violent criminals themselves. This is a result of a case at the European Court of Human Rights—nothing to do with the European Union—in 1998. But the judges didn’t order British police to give warning notices to gangsters, or indeed to anyone. What they said was that, in certain circumstances, the state has to take action to protect people whose life is at risk. Delivering warnings is the police response to that legal duty. Nottinghamshire Police describes its role as follows: “As a general rule, when a person is considered to be in real and immediate danger from the criminal actions of another, the Police should warn the intended victim.” On 7 March 1988, a teacher called Paul Paget-Lewis shot dead Ali Osman, the father of a pupil with whom he had developed an unhealthy obsession. He also killed the son of his deputy head teacher, and injured Mr Osman’s son Ahmet. Among the fallout was a judgment from the European Court of Human Rights over a decade later. The Osman family argued that “despite the clear warning signals given the police failed to take appropriate and adequate preventive measures to secure effective protection for their lives”.  They were relying on Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been interpreted to mean that states may have a ‘positive obligation to protect people’s lives. In other words, countries sometimes have to be proactive in preventing death, not just refrain from killing their citizens. The court said that a country would be breaking human rights law if “the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and… failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk”. But the court found there was no point at which the police knew or should have known that there was a real and immediate risk to the lives of the Osman family. So they lost their claim under Article 2. The case is widely accepted to have led to the practice of ‘threat to life warnings’.  The existence of threat to life warnings in response to the Osman case has been widely reported recently, following an interview given by former justice minister Dominic Raab. Mr Raab said on 29 September that “Greater Manchester police… as a result of that ruling, have to give tip-offs and notify gangsters who are fighting each other and that absorbs a huge amount of their time”. He argued that time could be better spent “prioritising threats to innocent, law-abiding citizens”. It’s not always obvious from the resulting coverage that this has been the law for some time. The Mail doesn’t mention the date of the Osman ruling until some 20 paragraphs in, while the Express doesn’t mention it at all. Newspaper reports also tend to say that the court directly told the British police to protect criminals in particular. As the facts of the Osman case show, that’s not what happened. In practice, though, gang members seem to be receiving a lot of these warnings. Greater Manchester Police told local press last year that “It is not unusual for us to issue these warnings to people who we think are at risk and in most cases these are given to members of organised crime gangs and their families”. The protections given by human rights law apply to criminals just as they do to anyone else. The government has no plans to leave the European Convention on Human Rights or the jurisdiction of the associated court. But it does want to replace the Human Rights Act, which makes the convention part of UK law and ensures that decisions of the court on what the convention means have to be taken into account by British judges. We haven’t yet seen the text of the British Bill of Rights that would replace the Human Rights Act. But it’s not at all certain that a new bill would alter the system of ‘threat to life warnings’. The Bill of Rights might remove any requirement for British judges to “take into account” rulings of the human rights court in Strasbourg. But that doesn’t mean that they would ignore past judgments like Osman, or overrule them in future. And if the UK courts did start to go a different way on human rights law, people affected could still complain to the Strasbourg court. That’s what happened in the Osman case, which was decided in 1998—two years before the Human Rights Act came into force. So if you think ‘threat to life warnings’ are a problem, the policy of bringing in a British Bill of Rights while staying signed up to the human rights convention may not solve it.","‘Threat to life warnings’ are a police response to the human rights court’s requirement that the state sometimes has to be proactive in protecting people from threats. That decision dates from 1998, and wasn’t about criminals in particular.

148,fullfact,"EU law means that the UK will be covered by human rights laws even if we scrap the Human Rights Act.
","  ""Even if we scrap the Human Rights Act, we'll still be beholden to EU laws"" Daily Telegraph, 28 July 2015 ""Only by leaving the EU will we escape human rights legislation"" Campaign for an Independent Britain, 16 October 2014 Two European sources influence human rights law in the UK: one being EU human rights laws, the other being the European Convention on Human Rights—which isn't EU legislation, and has had a far greater impact so far. Leaving the EU wouldn't make a difference to the Convention. What it would mean is that we aren't covered by EU human rights laws, which haven't had as much of an impact so far, but are in some ways more wide-ranging. These laws are contained in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights. We'd need to both leave the EU and repeal the Human Rights Act to prevent anyone from relying on human rights in court. And even then, the UK would still have obligations under international law, because of the Convention and similar treaties. Scrap the Human Rights Act, leave the Convention, and you still have EU human rights law in place The Charter hasn't been as important as the Convention, which the UK has been signed up to for decades. It wasn't legally binding before 2009, so nobody could rely on it alone before a court, although it was considered significant—it was often mentioned by the EU Court of Justice, for example. The Lisbon Treaty gave this Charter 'direct effect' from 2009. It now has ""the same legal value as the Treaties"" that give the EU its authority. The Charter overlaps with the Convention. For good measure, the Treaties say that Convention rights ""constitute general principles of the Union's law"". The Campaign for an Independent Britain and UKIP say that we can't, as an EU member, leave the Convention altogether. Opinions are divided on this; one expert puts it no higher than ""arguable"". But in addition to including Convention rights, the Charter goes on to list many other rights, freedoms, protections and prohibitions. Many, if not all, of these already existed in EU law—the Charter is partly an exercise in setting them all out in one place. As a senior judge said in the High Court in 2013, ""that much wider Charter of Rights would remain part of our domestic law even if the Human Rights Act were repealed"". EU human rights law doesn't always apply, but can have a big impact when it does Being able to rely on EU human rights, as opposed to European Convention rights, in a UK court is important. As already mentioned, they're more wide-ranging; but even where they're identical to what's in the Convention, EU rights can lead to more potent legal outcomes. A court can and must strike down UK legislation that conflicts with EU law—including the Charter. By contrast, where there is a conflict between an Act of Parliament and the Convention, senior judges can only make a formal declaration to that effect. This is a signal to Parliament, or the relevant Minister, that it should change the law (this generally happens in practice, but not always). There are some limits on use of the Charter. It only applies to situations covered by EU law. There are quite a lot of these, however, and the Supreme Court has said that the concept is to be ""interpreted broadly"". There has also been some debate about whether or not an addition to the Lisbon Treaty, 'Protocol 30', might prevent people from using the Charter as freely as they might otherwise. The EU Court of Justice has decided that Protocol 30 ""does not call into question the applicability of the Charter in the United Kingdom""—so it certainly doesn't give us an 'opt-out' from EU human rights law. Judges here have said that it's ""far from clear"" what it does achieve. It certainly hasn't prevented them from ruling that UK law has to be 'disapplied' because of a conflict with the Charter in several recent cases. Impact of EU human rights law demonstrated in recent case on surveillance A case brought by two MPs, David Davis and Tom Watson, shows the potential that the Charter has to impact on UK law, with or without the Convention. The High Court held in July that an important law authorising interception of communications data has to go (although it suspended the effect of its decision until 31 March 2016). The judges said that the EU Court of Justice had gone further than the European Court of Human Rights in its approach to privacy rights in the Charter, which is ""more specific"" on the protection of personal data than the Convention. This EU human rights judgment would have happened whether or not the human rights law we're more used to was in force.","This is correct. The EU now has a stand-alone system of human rights law, which would remain in place even if we scrapped the older, separate system set up by the Human Rights Act and European Convention on Human Rights.

239,fullfact,"Being caught urinating in public could put you on the sex offenders register. 
","""Whilst at medical school, a Dean pointed out to us that anybody caught urinating in public may end up on the sex offenders register""—via email, 23 June 2015 We received an email recently asking about the number of doctors that are sexual offenders (our answer to that is here) mentioning this claim, which seems to be of general interest. Our response to the Dean is that it's very unlikely. People have to register with the police after being convicted or cautioned for certain, listed sexual offences. The list includes the crime of ""exposure"" of the genitals, but to be convicted of that the person must have intended to be seen by someone and to cause them ""alarm or distress"". The Scottish offence of ""sexual exposure"", which also gives rise to registration, specifies that the exposure has to be ""in a sexual manner"", as well as intentional. A clandestine duck behind a wall isn't likely to satisfy these kinds of criteria, although a very public display is obviously more risky. Urinating in public without the intention to expose oneself and ""alarm"" others will usually be charged under a local byelaw or the Public Order Act 1986, according to the College of Policing. That kind of conviction is not ""sexual"" and doesn't require registration as a sexual offender. Even if a court felt that there was a sexual element to your behaviour, the requirement to register as a sexual offender doesn't follow automatically. Unless someone who saw you is under 18, you wouldn't have to register if fined rather than sent to prison.","Very unlikely. Being convicted of exposure requires an intention to be seen by others, and not everyone convicted of that offence has to register.

22,fullfact,"There are 80 courts in the UK enforcing Sharia law. 
","""There are 80 practising Sharia courts around the United Kingdom, and I've got no problem with different religions and different groups having their own private observance, but the law should be the law."" Nigel Farage, 14 January 2015 Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on Wednesday, the leader of UKIP referred to ""80 practising Sharia courts around the United Kingdom"". While there are undoubtedly lots of different councils and tribunals dealing with Sharia principles, they are not courts of law. And a European University Institute paper from 2009 says that it's not clear how many exist, or how many different types there are. An estimate of ""85 at least"" was given in a 2009 report by the think tank Civitas, but it includes online forums and admits that the actual number is ""indeterminate"". UKIP have told us that Mr. Farage took his information from a 2014 interview in the Telegraph, in which a member of the House of Lords, Baroness Cox, mentions the same figure as Civitas. But as far as we are aware, there are no definitive studies. Sharia councils usually give judgments on religious matters, but there are some circumstances in which a court of law might uphold decisions they make. Generally speaking, courts won't interfere with decisions that are purely religious, but they don't accord them legal status either. For instance, civil marriage recognised by the state for official purposes is different to the religious rituals that make it valid in the eyes of a given God. The religious celebrant has to comply with certain legal formalities, and must be authorised to register marriages in some cases. Equally, the paperwork required for a civil marriage or divorce needn't be recognised by your church. For this reason, many Sharia organisations exist to issue Islamic divorce certificates, and give advice on other aspects of religious law. One piece of research from the University of Reading has identified 30 major councils, and some smaller ones, providing these services. The way Sharia becomes legally binding is where a council or similar body is used for arbitration. This means taking a commercial or personal dispute—never anything covered by criminal law—to a neutral forum and agreeing to be bound by what it decides. It's up to the people having the dispute who they agree to be the arbiter, and they can even choose to apply rules other than English law to the affair (so long as there is no conflict between the two). So if both parties agree, arbiters can decide certain issues by applying religious principles. This doesn't make them courts as such; their legal authority comes from being voluntarily chosen as a decision-maker, and they can't make any decisions that are contrary to national law. The Muslim Arbitration Tribunal is an example of this approach. It appoints one solicitor or barrister, and one expert in Islamic law, to each case. In this way, it tries to ensure that the decision reached is in line with both secular and religious law. Personal choice is also relevant to understanding last year's controversy over the Law Society's guidance—since withdrawn—on Sharia-compliant wills, which was reported as Islamic law being enshrined in the UK's legal system. In general, people can leave their property to whoever they want, in whatever proportion. So wills can be drafted in a way that complies with Islamic law as well as the law of the land.","People can agree to ask a Sharia council to make a legally binding decision, but this must be in line with English law. No-one knows how many councils exist.

8,fullfact,"Ofcom has rules that the Green Party can't take part in the televised leaders' debates. 
","""Media regulator Ofcom said it believed the Green party was not important enough to be included in the televised general election debates"" - Huffington Post, 8 January 2015 An Ofcom consultation on what it considers to be 'major political parties' was published yesterday. It's been reported as a ""ruling"" on the participation of smaller parties in the televised leaders' debates, affecting in particular the Green Party. But the regulator ""has no role in determining"" who gets to take part. So what's going on? Political broadcasting rules Ofcom come into this in the first place because political debate on television and radio is much more tightly controlled than in the print and online media. Political advertising on TV and radio is banned. Instead, broadcasters are required to carry 'party political broadcasts', in which the parties have a few minutes to pitch to voters. Ofcom sets rules for these, including the extra broadcasts that can be made during a general election campaign, that apply to the likes of ITV, Channel 5, Five and S4C (but not the BBC or Sky). All 'major parties' should be offered a minimum of two general election broadcasts, and parties with candidates in one-sixth of constituencies or more (such as the Green Party) should be offered a minimum of one. Broadcasters are free to offer more than this, and to treat the different political parties differently. But in practice, they tend to get together (along with the BBC and Sky) to make sure all parties get consistent treatment on the different channels. Broadcasters decide who debates The same is true of the televised leaders' debates. The BBC, Channel 4, ITV and Sky working together have suggested three debates in the run-up to the election: This has upset some of the smaller parties, who argue that they should be included as well. What's this got to do with Ofcom's definition of 'major parties', then? While the regulator doesn't have a view on TV debates specifically, the Ofcom code that broadcasters have to follow generally—in terms of fairness and impartiality—still applies. And one of these rules says that ""Due weight must be given to the coverage of major parties during the election period."" This means that anyone on the list of 'major parties' would be on very solid ground in arguing to the broadcasters, Ofcom, and ultimately the courts that excluding them from the debates would be a breach of this rule. In 2010, both Plaid Cymru and the SNP complained to Ofcom that it was a breach of the code to exclude them from the debates in that year—both failed in their challenge, partly because they were 'major parties' in Wales/Scotland only, and the debates were about an all-UK election. Ofcom's provisional decision What Ofcom said yesterday was that in reviewing the list of 'major parties', its ""initial view"" is that the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats should remain as 'major parties' in Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland), and that UKIP should be added to the list for England and Wales (but not Scotland). It considered the claims of the Green Party, and rejected them. The provisional decision was based on past election results and current polling support. You can read a summary of its reasoning here and the full report here. This isn't the final word; political parties and other ""stakeholders"" have until 5 February to persuade Ofcom to change its mind.","It's not the regulator's call, but keeping the Greens off the list of 'major parties' means broadcasters are legally entitled to leave them out of the debates.

9,fullfact,"The Department for Work and Pensions is or isn't carrying out a review of 60 suicides linked to benefits. 
","""We've got 60 people who have committed suicide and their suicides are linked to benefits [...] the Department of Work and Pensions is supposed to be reviewing 60 cases where people have committed suicide""—Jonathan Bartley, Green Party Work and Pensions spokesperson, 5 May 2015 ""No, we have not carried out a review [...] you cannot make allegations about individual cases, in tragic cases where obviously things go badly wrong, you can't suddenly say this is directly as a result of government policy""—Iain Duncan Smith, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, 5 May 2015 Yesterday's Daily Politics welfare debate became heated when the Green Party's Jonathan Bartley raised the sensitive issue of suicides linked to welfare reform. Iain Duncan Smith dismissed the allegation of a link between changes to benefits and people taking their own lives as ""scurrilous"" and ""cheap"", denying the existence of a review into 60 such cases. We can't say anything on the causal link between individual suicides and the government's welfare policy. But surely only one of the politicians can be right about the existence of a review: either it has happened or it hasn't? Well, as is so often the case, there's more to it than that. It depends on what you mean by ""a review"". The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) carries out internal 'Peer Reviews' to ensure that its standards have been followed and to suggest improvements to how it does things. It stresses that ""Peer Reviews are a continuous improvement tool and are not to be used to seek out or apportion blame"". A minister has described the Peer Review process as asking the question ""was everything that we did... right?"" and helping to ""ensure that we follow all of our processes correctly"". DWP guidance says that ""where suicide is associated with DWP activity, a Peer Review must be undertaken"". There have been a number of Freedom of Information requests on this subject. The figure of 60 deaths (although not necessarily suicides) being reviewed appears in one of DWP's replies, from November 2014. But in February 2015, the DWP said that this was an error, and ""in fact only 49 of these reviews had been conducted in circumstances where the claimant had died"". Of these, 40 were ""following a suicide or apparent suicide"". 33 of the reviews into deaths contained recommendations for either local DWP offices or national attention. This figure only accounts for Peer Reviews from February 2012 onward—national records on Peer Reviews weren't kept before then. The Conservative Party has told us that Mr Duncan Smith was referring specifically to the lack of ""an overall review of any causality or anything that encompasses all of the 60 cases, other than the standard practice [of Peer Reviews]."" None of these Peer Reviews have been published. The DWP has given two reasons why it's not obliged to publish them under the Freedom of Information Act. These boil down to the fact that these reviews contain sensitive personal information, and the argument that disclosing them would prevent the authors of Peer Reviews from writing as candidly as they otherwise would—making them less useful internally. The Disability News Service says that it has reported a concern about this interpretation of the law with the Information Commissioner's Office, which has the power to overrule the DWP.","The DWP has carried out internal 'Peer Reviews' in 40 individual cases since February 2012 after the suicide or apparent suicide of a customer.

10,fullfact,"The party with the most MPs gets to form the government.
","""The next government won't depend on who is the largest party... governments in the House of Commons are about who can command a majority."" Nicola Sturgeon, 24 April 2015 ""The biggest party gets to form the government"" Jim Murphy MP, 7 March 2015 The leader of the Scottish National Party said on Newsnight last night that she will attempt to keep the Conservative Party out of government after the election, even if it has up to 40 seats more than any other party. But Scottish Labour has said previously that the largest political party forms the government. Is this right? In these terms, no. Labour are correct in saying that the party with the most MPs after every election since 1929 has proceeded to take power. But as Nicola Sturgeon says, there's no rule preventing a smaller party or parties taking over either. Confidence of the Commons The most important thing about forming a government is that it must ""command the confidence of the elected House of Commons"". When one party has an overall majority—that is, more MPs than every other party put together—this condition is obviously satisfied. So in the event that Labour won an overall majority in May, the current government would have to resign and the Queen would invite Ed Miliband to become Prime Minister. A House divided But the more likely scenario—according to the opinion polls—is a hung parliament, in which no single party has an overall majority of MPs. This happened in 2010, resulting in the current coalition. What then? If the negotiations after that result produce a viable new government between two smaller parties—for instance, a Labour/SNP coalition—that's the government we get. It doesn't have to include the largest party. That's easy. But what's more complex is the dynamics of the game of thrones that would follow the election of a hung Parliament. As there could be a number of viable political combinations, and a government can stay in power with fewer than a majority of MPs actively supporting it, the party leader with the first opportunity to form the government has an advantage. So are there rules about who gets the first attempt at trying to ""command the confidence"" of the Commons? Incumbency trumps size In the short term, the incumbent Prime Minister is entitled to remain in office to see whether he or she has enough support to stay on. In 1974 the Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath tried to form a new coalition government even after an election that left the opposition, Labour, the biggest party. David Cameron would be entitled to do the same, even if outnumbered by Labour (or by Labour and the SNP). He only has to resign before a vote to test the confidence of the House if it were clear that he no longer has it. Shifting sands? That said, in 2010 the Conservatives took the initiative in negotiating with the Liberal Democrats even though Labour, the incumbents, could technically have put together a viable combination. More recently, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party said on 29 March that, while he would be open to a deal with either Labour or the Conservatives, ""in the first instance constitutionally we would want to go to the party that has won the most seats"". As academics from the UCL Constitution Unit point out, it's no longer clear whether size or incumbency is the deciding factor in who gets first dibs on trying to form a government. Ultimately, the attitude of the various political parties will establish this. A political rather than legal process  In the context of the current election, it could be that the Conservatives don't get an overall majority but end up as the incumbents and the largest party—so Labour might accept their right of first opportunity to form the government. Remember, though, that if they fail it's perfectly legitimate for two smaller parties to form a coalition. The most obvious potential for dispute is where the Conservatives end up with slightly fewer seats than Labour, who could say that they should get first opportunity based on size, while the Conservatives say that they get first opportunity based on incumbency. Experts are divided on what, as a matter of strict constitutional law, should happen then. One school of thought says that the Queen should have a role to play in resolving the deadlock, while others feel that it's entirely a matter for the politicians to argue out among themselves. But in some respects there's no such thing as strict constitutional law in the UK, and hard political facts ultimately override many of these subtleties. A Labour/SNP bloc that could out-vote the Conservatives in the House of Commons would, if it wanted to, be able to eject them eventually in a vote of confidence. As the academic J.A.G. Griffith famously put it, ""the constitution is no more and no less than what happens"". Update 17 March 2015 Scottish Labour have been in touch about this issue. The party says that ""our point refers to election outcomes, rather than procedure or process"", pointing out that in practice, the largest party has formed the government after every election since 1929. Therefore, Scottish Labour say, it's accurate to state that ""the largest party forms the government after the election. That has been the case in every UK election since women got the vote"". A claim that the largest party—with or without an overall majority—generally forms the government, rather than must form the government, is perfectly accurate. A claim that no government can legitimately be formed without including the largest party is not.","In a hung Parliament, there's no rule that the largest party forms a government. It might get the first chance to try, but the incumbent can also claim this.

11,fullfact,"MPs would need to approve British military action in Syria.
","""Britain is not taking part in the action in Syria because MPs have so far refused to authorise the extension of airstrikes in neighbouring Iraq."" Mail Online, 16 November 2015 ""I need to take it to Parliament"" David Cameron, 16 November 2015 In the aftermath of the atrocity in Paris, there's been a renewed focus on UK military action against Islamic State in Syria. It's claimed that this would need parliamentary approval. That may be so politically, but not legally. Strictly speaking, as the House of Lords Constitution Committee has put it: ""The decision to engage in armed conflict is one for the Government; Parliament has no legal role in authorising or approving the use of the armed forces overseas"". Even more strictly speaking, deploying the armed forces is a 'royal prerogative'—a power held by the Queen, but in practice exercised on her behalf by ministers. What about MPs, though? If there's no legal reason to consult them, why does the Prime Minister say he needs to win a vote before taking the military action he wants? We can do no better than point to the comprehensive briefing by the House of Commons Library on this subject. It notes that the Labour government held a vote on sending troops to Iraq in 2003, even though there was no formal requirement for it. That led to debate in subsequent years about creating a more direct role for MPs in authorising military force. The Coalition government said in 2011 that it accepted that there was, by then, a constitutional convention: ""before troops are committed, the House should have an opportunity to debate the matter. We propose to observe that convention except when there is an emergency"". One definition (there are many) of constitutional conventions is ""practices which are politically binding on all involved, but not legally binding"". But they aren't an exact science. The government made the commitment above on 11 March 2011. On 19 March, the UK began military operations in Libya. The House of Commons didn't vote on the matter until 21 March. Professor Gavin Phillipson argues that the convention to consult MPs before taking military action wasn't honoured in this case; the authors of Constitutional and Administrative Law, by contrast, use the vote as an example of the convention in action. Another complication that might have applied in the Libyan case is that the convention excludes ""emergency"" situations where there isn't time to get parliamentary approval. And as deploying military force can take many forms, in some cases the convention mightn't be triggered. The government argued that there was no vote necessary when troops were sent to Mali in 2013, for instance, as they weren't in a ""combat role"". But whatever about the details, there's no real doubt now that the convention exists and would cover something like air strikes in Syria. It's mentioned in the Cabinet Manual—the official guide to how the country is run. And in 2013, when MPs voted against intervening in Syria, the government dropped the idea. Arguably, then, the convention now requires not just that MPs be consulted on the use of armed force, but that they vote for it. A vote against it ""would make military action impossible, at least until circumstances changed"". This is still speaking politically, rather than legally: a constitutional convention is just that, a settled political understanding. It can be broken. Some Conservative politicians hint that they'd like to break this one. Dr Liam Fox, a former defence secretary, reportedly said yesterday that waiting for parliamentary approval isn't ""constitutionally correct. I don't believe it's necessary, but it seems to be the convention that we have adopted"". As the constitutional expert Peter Hennessy puts it, these conventions are fragile: ""they can crumble at the touch of a powerful, insensitive and determined"" government. So while it makes sense for the Prime Minister to build public and political support for intervention in Syria, he is entitled to act without it.","Legally, the government doesn't need the permission of Parliament to use military force. But there is a convention that it will consult MPs before doing so, where possible, and abide by the outcome of their vote.

12,fullfact,"There is no constitutional requirement for a Parliamentary recall or vote before military intervention.
","“In the abstract there’s no constitutional requirement either for a Parliamentary recall or for a parliamentary vote [for military action].” Jo Johnson MP, 12 April 2018 “In a situation where there isn't that [imminent danger of an attack]... [it] has become the convention that Parliament is the place to authorise military action.” Barry Gardiner MP, 12 April 2018 The Prime Minister has the power—through the Crown—to decide when to take military action. There’s no legal requirement that parliament is involved. The House of Lords Constitution Committee says that: ""The decision to engage in armed conflict is one for the Government; Parliament has no legal role in authorising or approving the use of the armed forces overseas"" However, since 2011 governments have argued for the convention that military action be put to a parliamentary vote in non-emergency cases. There is no formal legislation asserting this, but the government has put three interventions to a parliamentary vote since 2013. Most of the information in this article is drawn from this House of Commons Library briefing. The government has legal authority over how to deploy the armed forces. This power is vested in the government by the Queen. In cases of a declaration of war, or committing armed forces to military action, then it is the Prime Minister alone who has the power to take that decision. Constitutional convention asserts that the Prime Minister takes that decision on behalf of the Queen, with consultation from the Cabinet, and advice from the National Security Council and the Chief of Defence Staff. But in the last fifteen years, parliament has started to play a greater role in deciding whether or not to deploy troops. Parliament does not have any legal authority to approve or reject the deployment of troops, but the government may choose to seek parliamentary approval if it wishes. The 2003 Iraq War “was the first example in modern times of prior parliamentary approval having been sought, and granted”, according to the House of Commons Library. It also notes that the Iraq vote “was regarded by advocates of a formal role for Parliament as setting a precedent for any future decisions on military action.” In 2011 the government said: “since the events leading up to the deployment of troops in Iraq, a convention exists that Parliament will be given the opportunity to debate the decision to commit troops to armed conflict and, except in emergency situations, that debate would take place before they are committed.” However, this convention was not enshrined in any legislation. Troops were deployed in Afghanistan in 2006 without a parliamentary debate or vote, for instance. In 2011, at the same time as the government was arguing for this convention, forces were deployed in Libya without a debate or vote. The government argued that the urgency of the situation demanded immediate action, and later tabled a motion seeking retrospective approval for the action, which was approved by parliament.  Just after the deployment of troops in Libya in 2011, Professor Nigel White at the University of Nottingham, said: “I don’t think there is a constitutional convention or unwritten law that Parliament should be consulted about conflict decisions… there is simply a very uneven trend of Parliament asserting itself towards greater consultation, greater debate.” Since 2011, the government has sought parliamentary approval for military action three times: in 2013 (in Syria), in 2014 (in Iraq), and in 2015 (in Syria). In the first instance, parliament voted against military action, and the government chose not to take action as a result. Professor Nigel White said that vote “has been important for democracy because it showed that although executives have the legal power to go to war or to use force, they are increasingly concerned with gaining approval from the wider polity”. In the 2013 and 2014 cases the government emphasised the importance of consulting parliament on military action, where possible. The position has been that parliament need not be consulted in an emergency, with then-Prime Minister David Cameron saying in 2014: “it is important that a Prime Minister and a Government reserve the right to act swiftly without consulting the Commons in advance in some specific circumstances—for instance, if we had to prevent an immediate humanitarian catastrophe or, indeed, secure a really important, unique British interest.” There have been military deployments since 2011 where the government has not consulted parliament. But in these cases (Mali in 2013, and Ukraine in 2015) the government argued that the situation did not involve combat troops and (in the Mali case) and was an emergency. In 2016, the government continued to argue that since 2011 “a Convention had developed in Parliament that before troops were committed the House of Commons should have an opportunity to debate the matter and said that it proposed to observe that Convention except where there was an emergency and such action would not be appropriate.” However, it also decided at this time that it would not be codifying this convention into law. It cited concerns over freedom of government action and the possibility that it would make deployment decisions a matter of the courts, rather than government authority. “After careful consideration, the Government have decided that it will not be codifying the convention in law or by resolution of the House in order to retain the ability of this and future Governments and the armed forces to protect the security and interests of the UK in circumstances that we cannot predict, and to avoid such decisions becoming subject to legal action.” This statement was made before Theresa May’s first government, so it’s not clear if it still reflects current government position. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Correct. There’s no legal requirement that parliament is involved in these decisions, the power rests with the Prime Minister, through the Crown.

Mostly—this has been argued by governments since 2011. But there’s still some question over which circumstances the convention applies under, and it’s not legally binding.

13,fullfact,"Adoption without parental consent is unusual outside England and Wales.
","""England is unusual in Europe in even permitting adoption without parental consent, indeed in the teeth of parental opposition—what I shall refer to as 'non-consensual adoption'—and even more unusual in the degree to which it has recourse to non-consensual adoption"" Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division, 2 November 2015 ""Only three out of 28 European Union countries allow forced or non-consensual adoption."" Sir Nicholas Mostyn, High Court judge, 18 September 2014 Orders for adoption, Sir James Munby once wrote, are ""amongst the most drastic that any judge in any jurisdiction is ever empowered to make"". Particularly sensitive is the issue of children adopted without parental consent. That can happen where parents aren't capable or available to give consent, but also over an explicit parental refusal when a child's welfare requires it. This is ""the last resort"", only allowed ""where nothing else will do"". In the Court of Appeal today, the same judge claimed that such ""non-consensual"" or ""forced"" adoptions are rarely possible outside the legal system of England and Wales. This idea has found its way from the pronouncements of respected family court judges into newspapers. But academic researchers have challenged it. Research suggests that non-consensual adoption is theoretically possible across Europe ""Contrary to popular opinion, every country in Europe has a mechanism for permitting adoption without parental consent, in certain circumstances"", according to Dr Claire Fenton-Glynn in a study published earlier this year. A separate report from 2014 disagrees that it is universally possible, but accepts that there are at least 20 European countries where adoption can take place without consent. We don't know where Mr Justice Mostyn sourced the figure of three out of 28 EU countries. ITV has reported along similar lines in the past, saying that ""the United Kingdom is one of only two countries in the European Union to allow forced adoption—the other is Croatia"". But Dr Fenton-Glynn lists a dozen countries that are similar to Croatia in that adoption without consent is permitted where parents have had their ""parental rights"" taken away. In other places, consent isn't necessary where the child has been abandoned by their parents. As this suggests, lack of consent doesn't necessarily mean resistance, which seems to be what campaigners have in mind when they talk about ""forced adoption"". Overruling the express wishes of parents may also be what the President of the Family Division (who cited this research to back up his claim) meant by ""in the teeth of parental opposition"". In 10 jurisdictions, including England and Wales, there are circumstances where active parental refusal can be overridden in granting the adoption order, according to Dr Fenton-Glynn. It seems fair to say that these countries are in the minority, although not necessarily unusual. Experts think England and Wales uses non-consensual adoption a lot more in practice Whatever about the theoretical possibilities, England and Wales certainly seems unusual in ""the degree to which it has recourse to non-consensual adoption"". Dr Fenton-Glynn says that ""few—if any—States exercise this power to the extent to which the English courts do"" (although there don't appear to be comparable statistics available). As a result, there have been complaints from other European countries about how our care system works. The case that the Court of Appeal decided today, for instance, was about a Hungarian family. A lot more detail on ""forced adoption"" is available at the Child Protection Resource.","Research suggests that all or most other European countries do allow non-consensual adoption in some circumstances. But it seems much rarer in practice than in England and Wales.

23,fullfact,"A judge refused to allow a child to live with her grandparents, instead of being adopted, because they were too old. 
","""The grandparents of a three-year-old girl have been blocked from adopting her because they are 'too old'"" Daily Mail, 21 July 2015 ""On first glance its disgusting they shouldn't be able to care for child. Second glance is their something in past that's not be disclosed in story"" Comment below Daily Mail story Discussion 'below the line' isn't something we regularly cite, to say the least. But in this case, the reader's comment has hit the nail on the head. The decision about this child was not, according to the judge who made it, about age. The case was about whether a three-year-old girl should be adopted. Her mother, who has mental health problems, didn't actually oppose this, but the child's maternal grandparents did and applied to take care of the child themselves. This was rejected in favour of adoption. Of the grandparents, the judge said that there was evidence that their parenting skills were not good; that there had been conflict between them and the child's mother; that the grandmother had a depressive illness; and mentioned their ages (70 and 58). The judgment then says: ""The main concern however it seems to me is the fact that this family would be in my judgment completely unable to cope with the triangular relationship of C, M and the grandparents. Mr G expressed in evidence that he hoped that his daughter was going to recover her mental health, that she had had some recent treatment that over the next four years might lead to her mental health recovering. I very much hope that that is the case and it may well be right, but he was very clear that he was going to continue his relationship with his daughter and indeed he is to be commended for that. He said he saw her yesterday. I just cannot envisage how the triangular relationship can possibly work. Dr Martinez in her report expresses the concern that mother is unable to bring up C because she is likely to expose C to extreme behaviours—'scary situations' is the word she uses—and she is referring to the incident in January when M in front of C self-harmed, cutting herself, and C was clearly in a scary situation witnessing her mother bleeding.  That is exactly the type of situation which Dr Martinez envisages recurring and which puts C at the risk of significant harm if she were to be placed with her mother. If I were to envisage C being placed with her grandparents it seems to me that it is only a matter of time before C is put in that situation again.  This is because of the conflict which the grandparents will experience in their meetings with their daughter, who they will not be able to turn away and in the conflict that is likely ultimately to create and which C is inevitably going to experience. Their personal circumstances are not ideal but ultimately it is that relationship which it seems to me makes it impossible for their application to succeed."" The judge also referred to the disruption caused to the plans for adoption that were already underway, in dismissing the grandparents' application. Most outlets airing the idea that this was because of how old the grandparents were reported it as an allegation by them, rather than as a fact. It's understandable that, in talking to the press, they would focus on the comments about age, instead of any of the other things the judge said about them. As a family law blogger puts it: ""I don't fault the grandparents at all for this—Courts can be confusing and scary places, and Judges use language and concepts that aren't commonplace for ordinary people. Add to that, that of course this was an emotionally charged hearing and it is little surprise that the grandparents left not completely understanding all the reasons why the Judge said no to them, and that they got the wrong end of the stick. Nor do I blame the journalist—if the judgment had borne out what the grandparents said, that a Court had ordered that the child be adopted purely because the grandparents were too old, that would be a miscarriage of justice and a scandal worth reporting."" This story seems to have been first reported by the Echo, a local newspaper covering Essex, on 21 July. But it wasn't until most of the national media had repeated it that a press release, directing journalists' attention to the text of the decision made on 17 June, was released around close of business on the 23rd. You can read the judgment in its entirety here.","This isn't correct. Age was mentioned in passing in the judge's written decision, but not as the main reason for it.

28,fullfact,"Lawyers are complaining about legal aid reductions despite making more money.
","“Lawyers raked in £32.2bn in just ONE year… The money that lawyers make has shot up by nearly a quarter in just five years, it was revealed yesterday. Despite strikes by barristers over their pay levels and protests from senior lawyers who demand greater taxpayer subsidies, the legal profession has been booming, according to official figures.” Daily Mail, 2 January 2017 These figures are broadly correct, but lawyers have grounds for complaint about the way they’re used in the story. The figure of £32 billion comes from a report released in July 2016 by the Legal Services Board, a regulator. This is the turnover—revenue before costs and tax—generated by Britain’s legal sector in 2015, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. It’s not the take-home pay of lawyers. These figures do show a rise of almost a quarter since 2011. But alternative ONS figures show a smaller rise, of less than a fifth over the five-year period. No matter which figures are used, taking inflation into account and looking at growth from year to year rather than over several years would show a much smaller increase. More problematic is the contrast made between this picture of robust growth and the protests of lawyers over reductions in government legal aid spending. As barrister Barbara Rich puts it, the gist of the Mail’s story is that lawyers have “wrongly complained about financial pressures at a time when lawyers’ incomes were in fact rising”. But the legal sector is diverse. It’s perfectly possible for lawyers representing people granted government legal aid to be feeling the pinch, while those doing commercial work on the high street or for big corporate clients are growing their business. This is borne out by the figures. Turnover from legal aid work has been falling. Partly because of this and partly because of the rise in overall turnover, the proportion of the sector’s gross revenue accounted for by legal aid was down to 7% in 2014/15. It was 9% in 2006/07, according to the Legal Services Board. The Mail’s article notes that “former Justice Secretary Michael Gove abandoned the attempt to save £100 million from the £1.6 billion legal aid total at the beginning of this year”. That cut may have been dropped, but others weren’t: before this, the budget for legal aid was over £2 billion throughout the last decade, even before adjusting for inflation. The changes that made this reduction possible led to protests by criminal legal aid lawyers in particular. Their counterparts working in the likes of corporate, tax or intellectual property law weren’t directly affected, as their business comes from private clients rather than government legal aid. Solicitors working in legal aid earn around a third less than their counterparts who don’t take publicly-funded work, according to a 2015 survey by the Law Society. That’s not to say that such lawyers are poor: legal aid solicitors who own a stake in their firm earned an average of £70,000 that year: well over twice the national average. Again, that’s considerably less than equity partners who don’t take legal aid clients. As the Law Society told us, though, partners’ income is more like the profits from their company than a salary. Salaried solicitors have seen their incomes rise slowly but surely: the £44,000 average pay of an assistant or associate solicitor has risen 12% since 2000, adjusted for inflation.  Again, there’s considerable variation within that: the Law Society survey suggests that a quarter of those lawyers earned £35,000 or less, while another quarter—likely to be concentrated in large commercial firms—earned £64,000 or more. This distinction between privately-funded legal work and the publicly-funded part of the legal profession is the main reason that lawyers accuse the Mail of not comparing like with like.","Turnover in the legal sector overall has been rising, but legal aid is a relatively small and falling proportion of that.

14,fullfact,"The Conservatives introduced employment tribunal fees that stop workers from getting justice when treated unfairly.
","“[The Conservatives] were the party that introduced employment tribunal fees which prevent workers from getting justice when treated unfairly at work.” Chuka Umunna MP, 6 October 2016 Fees for employment tribunals were introduced in July 2013 by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Coalition government.  A person looking for compensation for, say, unpaid wages or unfair dismissal, has to pay between £400 and £1,200 to have the case heard. There are other fees which might have to be paid depending on the case, and these could be up to £600. To appeal a tribunal decision costs £1,600. Before that, there was no fee to take a case. The government said this needed to change to “encourage early resolution of workplace disputes and in order to transfer some of the cost burden from the taxpayer to the users of the system”.  Tribunal judges have the power to order the employer to reimburse fees if the person taking the case is successful. There’s also a “fee remission scheme” to exempt people on low incomes. Around 40% of all fees paid were either fully or partially reimbursed last year. The number of cases taken has fallen sharply since fees were introduced. The House of Commons Library says the continuing low level of claims may also have been affected by a conciliation scheme introduced in May 2014.  This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","The Coalition government introduced these fees, which can be repaid if cases are successful, but seem to have led to a big fall in number of people using employment tribunals.

24,fullfact,"The draft law that will start the process of leaving the EU has 133 words. The law enabling women to become MPs only has 70.
","“That bill, the Article 50 bill, which is designed to do nothing more than to start the negotiating process, has 133 words and Angus [Robertson] criticises it for not having enough words. Well, the bit of legislation enabling women to become members of Parliament had 70 words in it.”  James Cleverly MP, 26 January 2017 Parliament is being asked to pass a law allowing the Prime Minister to begin the process of leaving the EU by triggering Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. The European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill does have 133 words in it. Some are standard to any bill: the actual heart of the draft law only amounts to 50 words. Women got the right to sit in parliament in 1918. The first woman to be elected was Constance Markievicz, for Dublin St. Patrick’s, although as an Irish republican she chose not take up her seat. American-born Nancy Astor was the first woman to actually sit in the House of Commons. The law enabling women to become MPs comes to 95 words, by our reckoning. But the point that the length of a law is irrelevant to its importance is spot on. The Supreme Court said as much on 24 January. But it’s not correct to say that the bill does “nothing more” than start the negotiating process. Because of the way Article 50 is designed, triggering it ends the UK’s membership once two years have passed, unless there is a negotiated deal setting another date, or the negotiations are extended. And, technically, it doesn’t start the negotiation/exit process anyway. It just gives the Prime Minister permission to do so. Even if the bill passes in its current form, there’ll still be no legal requirement for the UK to leave. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time.

Any MP that votes for this is potentially voting for semi-permanent EU membership. Saves them revoking Article 50 I suppose, which is what they really want. Utterly disgraceful. https://t.co/1ImMgwNRrA Yesterday the Labour MP Hilary Benn published the wording of a bill which he intends to present to Parliament this week. Its purpose is to prevent the UK leaving the EU on 31 October with no deal, unless parliament approves such an exit. Under the terms of the bill, if parliament has not either approved a no deal exit, or approved some form of withdrawal agreement by 19 October, then the Prime Minister must ask the EU for an extension to the Brexit date. This request should be for an extension of three months, pushing the Brexit date back from 31 October to 31 January. A number of people have claimed that under the bill’s provisions, the EU will be able to choose how long this extension is for, with the UK having no say over this. This is a reference to section 3(2) of the bill which states that, if the EU agrees to an extension of the Brexit date, but to a date other than 31 January, then the Prime Minister must agree to it. However, this overlooks a very important condition set out in the following subsection—which is cut out of the screenshot shared in many of the tweets. Section 3(3) says that the Prime Minister does not have to automatically agree to the extension. The government has the option to put the EU’s proposed extension date to a vote in parliament, and parliament can choose to reject the proposal. So the EU cannot unilaterally impose the date to which the Brexit deadline is extended—the UK has the power to reject it. The effect of this part of the bill is that the Prime Minister can accept the EU’s proposed extension without asking for parliament’s approval, but if they wish to reject it they must secure the agreement of parliament. Mr Benn’s bill has not yet been voted on by parliament. MPs are expected to vote today on whether or not to take control of setting the order of parliamentary business. If that happens then it’s expected that parliament will vote on the bill on Wednesday.

149,fullfact,"The UK could not bring in safer lorry designs until the EU legislated on the matter.
","“Indeed we seem to have gone backwards since the last Chequers meeting in February, when I described my frustrations, as Mayor of London, in trying to protect cyclists from juggernauts. We had wanted to lower the cabin windows to improve visibility; and even though such designs were already on the market, and even though there had been a horriﬁc spate of deaths, mainly of female cyclists, we were told that we had to wait for the EU to legislate on the matter… If a country cannot pass a law to save the lives of female cyclists - when that proposal is supported at every level of UK government - then I don't see how that country can truly be called independent.” Boris Johnson MP, 9 July 2018 Mr Johnson has made a variation of this claim—most recently made in his letter resigning as Foreign Secretary—several times in the past. It's correct that laws on lorry design standards are set at EU level. However, the EU did vote to amend its law on the matter in 2014, widening lorry design specifications to increase driver visibility and reduce the chance of serious injury in a low-speed collision. In the months prior to that vote, Mr Johnson criticised the British government for being opposed to the EU’s reforms (it eventually voted in favour, as did all EU member states). The new design is optional, not mandatory, and new-design lorries won’t be allowed on the road until 2019 or 2020. EU rules on the maximum dimensions of lorries were set out in a directive from 1996. As an EU member, the UK has to follow this directive. It is the reason why today’s lorries are “brick-shaped”, according to the European Commission. In 2014, the European Parliament voted to support an amendment to the directive, which allows lorries to exceed the legal dimensions if it makes them greener and safer. This change was first proposed in April 2013, the same year that Mr Johnson says he first wanted a change of law. These rules became a new law, or “directive” in 2015. The new rules allow manufacturers to produce lorry cabs that have a more rounded shape, which improves visibility for the driver and reduces the risk of serious injury in the event of a low-speed collision. The directive also aims to improve the environmental performance of lorries. These rules are not mandatory—older lorry designs will still be allowed on the road. The European Commission told us that the new-design trucks will appear on European roads as of 2020, and that the Commission has proposed to bring that date forward to 2019. It was widely reported in 2014 and 2015 that the delay in the trucks being allowed on the road was as a result of a compromise agreement with the French and Swedish governments. France and Sweden were pushing for the implementation of the law to be delayed by ten years, in order to protect their domestic lorry manufacturers. When the amendments were being debated in January 2014, Mr Johnson was quoted as saying they could “save literally hundreds of lives across the EU in years to come”. At the same time, he expressed concern that the UK government was not supportive of the EU amendments. “I am deeply concerned at the position of the British government and urge them to embrace this vital issue.” The government was quoted in response as confirming that it was not supporting the European Parliament’s proposals at the time. This runs counter to Mr Johnson’s suggestion that that a proposal to change the law on lorry design was “supported at every level of UK government” while they “had to wait for the EU to legislate”. It appears that the government initially opposed the EU’s attempt to legislate on the issue, only to later vote in favour of it. Update 10 July 2018  We updated the article with new information we received from the European Commission on when the new-design trucks will be allowed on the road.","The EU sets rules on permitted lorry dimensions, which we have to follow. But the EU voted to allow safer lorry designs in 2014, a plan which the UK government initially opposed.

29,fullfact,"The UK government killing British nationals fighting for Islamic State in Syria is lawful under international law.
","“To take them out using special services, I think, would be illegal under UK and international law.” Jacob Rees-Mogg, 26 October 2017 “You can sometimes use lethal force. ... You can even do it on the street of your town in the UK, if it is strictly necessary to save life. That is lawful under English criminal law and under international law.” Shami Chakrabarti, 26 October 2017 There’s a debate going on at the moment about what the government can and should do with British citizens in or returning from fighting in Syria for jihadist groups. There is no single authoritative statement of what’s allowed in international law. It starts with written treaties agreed between countries, but also includes custom and practice. All of these can be interpreted differently by different countries and not all countries are signed up to all treaties. The UK government has said that killing people in Syria can be lawful under international law. An RAF drone targeted and killed Reyaad Khan, a British national, in Syria in 2015. The UK government’s view of international law was set out in a speech by the Attorney General earlier this year. The UN Charter, the founding treaty of the United Nations, requires member states to “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force”. Article 51 makes an exception for “inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations”. That’s all in black and white. “Like many other states”, the Attorney General said, the UK believes that right extends to “self-defence against an ‘imminent’ armed attack” not just to when a country has already been attacked. In warfare, it's generally lawful to target enemy troops. But the UK government takes the view that international law may allow the use of force against individuals who are not members of a conventional foreign army.  It says force, which may be lethal force, may be used against these individuals if that's what's needed to defend the UK against an actual or imminent armed attack. The UK's view is that it can use force in self-defence against individuals based in a foreign state if that state is unable or unwilling to prevent an actual or imminent armed attack on UK interests. The same would apply if the foreign state does not have effective control of the territory from which the attack might come. The Attorney General says “a number of states” agree with the UK on that. So those are the arguments you would need to accept to agree with to accept the UK government’s argument about what strikes can be legal in international law. Finally, you would have to decide whether a particular strike is legal based on the facts of the case. Is it necessary? Is it proportionate? And what counts as an imminent threat? The Security Service MI5 says that “hundreds of British extremists” have travelled to Syria. Its Director General said in a speech: “A growing proportion of our casework now has some link to Syria, mostly concerning individuals from the UK who have travelled to fight there or who aspire to do so.” This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","It depends on how you interpret international law. Different states interpret it differently. The UK government believes it can be lawful in some circumstances.

15,fullfact,"Councils are making it a criminal offence to be poor.
","“Councils are making it a criminal offence to be poor” The Canary, 3 April 2017 Last summer the homelessness charity Crisis surveyed councils in England and Wales on “enforcement measures” in relation to rough sleeping in their area. These enforcement measures are used to tackle rough sleeping and the perceived anti-social behaviour linked to it. They can be informal, such as police officers moving rough sleepers on. Or they can be legal powers that come with formal penalties, such as court orders under the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014. Around 4,100 people were sleeping rough in England on one sample night in 2016. Across the whole of 2016 almost 60,000 households were accepted as “homeless” by councils, although many will have a physical roof over their heads in the short term. The Crisis report shows that at least some councils use formal enforcement powers against rough sleepers, although it’s not entirely clear how many. As the Canary reported, 36% of the 81 councils responding to an online survey said that they used enforcement powers of some kind to “specifically target rough sleeping”. Crisis said that “in the main” these were formal powers. But only 6% of the 305 councils replying to a separate Freedom of Information request said that they used formal powers under the 2014 Act. Crisis told us that the FOIs didn’t cover informal enforcement actions, although there still seems like a big difference in the two results. We’ve asked for more information. As some of these powers are used by the police, it might be that some councils are reporting enforcement measures being used in their area, rather than by council officials themselves. Whatever the exact proportion now, other councils say they plan to use formal enforcement powers in the future. But do they amount to making poverty a crime? At least one of the formal “enforcement measures” used by councils relies directly on criminal law. The Vagrancy Act 1824 makes rough sleeping (“wandering abroad and lodging … in the open air”) a criminal offence in itself. That said, only one person was sent to prison for “sleeping out” between 2005 and 2015. The Crisis report refers to Vagrancy Act “arrests” being used to tackle rough sleeping and begging, rather than actual prosecutions under the law. More common is the use of powers in a law passed this century: the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014. This allows for court orders aimed at curbing anti-social behaviour by threatening criminal penalties if the order is broken. They aren’t in themselves a criminal conviction. These orders include Injunctions to Prevents Nuisance and Annoyance (the new Anti-Social Behaviour Order); Community Protection Notices; Dispersal Orders; Public Spaces Protection Orders; and Criminal Behaviour Orders. The circumstances in which these orders can be handed out, and who has the power to use them, vary. But the upshot in most cases is that not obeying the order is a criminal offence. The exception is the Injunction to Prevent Nuisance and Annoyance, breaking which is dealt with as contempt of court. That’s not a criminal offence but can still lead to a fine or imprisonment. An example of a beggar being sent to prison for breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order—which can only be given to someone convicted of a crime, at the prosecution’s request—was reported recently in Coventry. As this highlights, these orders seem to be used more for “behaviour associated with rough sleeping” than to ban the practice of rough sleeping itself. Rough sleepers’ behaviour is “often perceived as anti-social”, as Crisis puts it—taking drugs or drinking outdoors, for instance. Complaints about this behaviour are partly the driving force behind these enforcement measures. But Crisis notes that councils are also motivated by “concerns for the wellbeing of those engaged in rough sleeping and anti-social street activities”. Its report found that “where targeted at genuine anti-social behaviour, and when integrated with high quality tailored support and accom[m]odation, formal enforcement measures—often used within a multi-agency setting—can act as a catalyst to help rough sleepers move away from street lifestyles and also move into accommodation”. If not used properly, though, the use of court orders and powers of arrest “only serves to displace rough sleepers geographically, leaving them at times marginalised and excluded from support services they rely on”. In practice, only one fifth of rough sleepers in Crisis’s sample were actually offered support such as emergency accommodation or help with alcoholism during their most recent experience of “enforcement measures”. This seems to be because they usually experience informal enforcement measures such as being moved on by a police officer, as opposed to a formal court order which is far more likely to be accompanied by an offer of official help. Correction 7 April 2017  We removed a duplicate word from the article. Correction 10 April 2017  We corrected a typo. ","It’s considerably more complicated than that. Councils and police are often responding to perceived anti-social behaviour from rough sleepers rather than poverty or homelessness in itself, but to address it they do use powers that can, directly or indirectly, lead to a criminal penalty.

16,fullfact,"A man who assaulted his wife was spared jail because the judge didn’t consider her “vulnerable”.
","“Man who hit wife with bat and made her drink bleach spared jail after judge says she was 'not vulnerable'.” Independent, 27 March 2017 “Domestic abuse victim blasts judge who spared cricketer husband jail 'because he didn't believe she is vulnerable'” Mirror, 29 March 2017 “A man who beat his wife with a cricket bat and forced her to drink bleach has been resentenced to 18 months after he avoided jail at an earlier hearing by falsely claiming to have a job offer as a professional cricketer.” Guardian, 7 April 2017 Mustafa Bashir, a cricketer, recently pleaded guilty to “assault occasioning actual bodily harm”. This is Victorian language for a crime that the Crown Prosecution Service will bring to trial in cases of “serious injury”. Mr Bashir had, reportedly, struck his wife, hit her with a cricket bat, and attempted to force her to drink bleach. The maximum sentence for assault occasioning actual bodily harm is five years in prison. The average jail sentence actually given to people found guilty of this crime in 2015 was just over a year. Mr Bashir, though, was originally given a suspended sentence of 18 months. A suspended sentence means no immediate jail time, but Mr Bashir could later have been sent to jail to serve the 18 months if he didn’t comply with behaviour requirements set by the judge. That changed on 7 April, when the case came back before Judge Richard Mansell QC. He found that Mr Bashir’s previous claim to have a professional cricket contract lined up was false. As future employment was no longer a consideration in favour of suspending the sentence, Mr Bashir was re-sentenced to serve the 18 months immediately. Media reports had attributed the suspension of the sentence to the judge deciding that Mr Bashir’s wife wasn’t “vulnerable”. As we suggested in an earlier version of this article, that’s not how it went. On his own account, Judge Mansell said that “I am not convinced on the guidelines that [the victim] was particularly vulnerable due to her personal circumstances”. Official guidelines require sentencing judges to look at whether the victim “is particularly vulnerable because of personal circumstances”. Newspaper reports of how this was expressed in the courtroom are different: “I am not convinced she was a vulnerable person.” So whether through misreporting or the judge departing from his notes on the day, the impression arose that he didn’t consider the victim vulnerable at all. Judge Mansell was at pains to correct that impression at the sentencing review: “I was doing no more and no less than making a finding, in accordance with the sentencing guidelines, that she was not particularly vulnerable as compared with other victims whose personal circumstances are different. She was, however, plainly vulnerable, as my sentencing remarks made perfectly clear.” The victim being particularly vulnerable is one of several factors that judges have to consider in arriving at the right length of sentence. If Judge Mansell had considered the victim “particularly vulnerable”, he might have calculated a longer sentence than the 18 months he eventually arrived at. But it wasn’t a consideration when it came to deciding whether or not that 18-month sentence should be served immediately or suspended. In taking the original decision to suspend the 18 months, Judge Mansell looked at the defendant’s previous good character, the delay since the assaults took place, his new relationship, employment—and the offer of future employment with Leicestershire County Cricket Club. The victim’s vulnerability didn’t come into that part of the decision. Rightly or wrongly, “it is not uncommon for judges to attach significant weight to the impact of a sentence upon a defendant’s employment”, according to a criminal barrister writing about the case. But when Leicestershire heard about the case, the club denied that any offer was on the table. Crown Court judges have the power to change a sentence within 56 days, including where “further information relevant to the sentence has become available to the court”. Judge Mansell used that power here, and sentenced Mr Bashir to go to jail immediately, having found “there is not a shred of evidence that you were ever chosen to play for Leicestershire”. We know this because the Judicial Office circulated these latest sentencing remarks to its press list. They haven’t been published on its website, but you can download and read the remarks in full from ours. Update 10 April 2017  We revised the article in light of the new sentence handed down.","The judge did mention that he didn’t consider the victim to be “particularly” vulnerable. Official sentencing guidelines required him to look into that as a possible aggravating factor in setting the length of the attacker’s sentence. It wasn’t relevant to his separate decision to suspend the sentence.

240,fullfact,"Recent changes to the law mean killers could avoid whole life terms by pleading guilty.
","“The worst murderers should be given a chance to escape staying in prison for life by pleading guilty, according to new rules drawn up for judges.” Daily Mail, 11 February 2016  Suggested new guidelines for judges, published today, wouldn’t significantly change the rules on when someone stays in prison for life. They spell out what the law has said since 2005. Sentencing for murder Criminal courts must follow sentencing guidelines unless it is contrary to the interests of justice to do so. The guidelines set out the required approach to sentencing, including relevant mitigating and aggravating factors in order to determine the appropriate sentence. In the case of murder, Parliament sets out a series of starting points based on the seriousness of the offence and the age of the offender. A judge may set a minimum term of imprisonment to be served. But if he or she doesn’t, the prisoner receives a whole life order, meaning they will never be released from prison. If a judge gives a whole life order, then the sentence can’t be reduced by a guilty plea. But judges must factor a guilty plea into their decision about whether or not there should be a whole life order in the first place. New guidelines don’t change the law This has been the position since a case decided so in 2005, so it’s incorrect to say that the new draft guidelines represent a change in the rules. The new draft guidelines replicate the decision of the Court of Appeal in 2005, in which the Lord Chief Justice said: “It [the court] must have regard to the guilty plea before it decides whether or not to order a whole life term. Having done so it is open to the court to decide that it is nonetheless appropriate to order a whole life term, but must then explain why the guilty plea has not affected the sentence.” The situation is different if the court decides not to give a whole life order. In these circumstances a guilty plea can reduce a sentence by a maximum of 1/6th but never more than five years.  The reason for the confusion is that guidelines produced in 2007 merely imply that guilty pleas should be factored into a decision about whether a whole life sentence is justified. Suggested new guidelines now make that point explicit.","The new sentencing guidelines don’t change the law. If a whole life order is made in court, a guilty plea will not reduce the sentence. However, a judge will factor a guilty plea into the decision about whether to make a whole life order in the first place.

241,fullfact,"Hundreds of convicted killers could be released from prison after a recent change to the law on 'joint enterprise'.
","“Hundreds of convicted criminals including murderers could walk free after the Supreme Court ruled the law of 'joint enterprise' has been wrong interpreted by judges for 30 years”. Daily Mail, 18 February 2016 “600 prisoners including Stephen Lawrence’s killers may walk under new rules” Daily Mirror, 19 February 2016 Yesterday the country’s highest court revised the ‘joint enterprise’ law on which some murder convictions have been based. But the Supreme Court stressed that a “general re-opening of old cases” based on the error wouldn’t happen. ‘Joint enterprise’ convictions The court’s change is about the law on being an ‘accessory’ to a crime. This is the legal rule that someone who assists or encourages a crime is as guilty as the person carrying it out. Before yesterday’s ruling the courts had said that where two people set out on a joint enterprise to commit crime A, and the second person had “foreseen the possibility” that the first person might go on to commit crime B, they are guilty of crime B as an accessory. The judgment clarified that the second’s person’s guilt actually requires intention, rather than foresight of the offence—and the court pointed out that the two are not the same thing. Old convictions may be appealed, but won’t necessarily succeed This change doesn’t mean that all previous convictions arrived at by applying the law as it was previously understood will be overturned. In its ruling the court said that those convicted under the old interpretation of the law who are out of time to appeal can apply for “exceptional leave to appeal”. But, importantly, exceptional leave will only be granted where “substantial injustice can be demonstrated”. It remains unclear how many old cases will be granted the right to appeal. It will depend on what exactly happened in each one.","People convicted of a 'joint enterprise' killing can appeal but the Supreme Court stressed when changing the law that it wouldn't automatically overturn all such cases. It depends whether the change would be relevant to a particular case and on there being a ""substantial injustice"".

242,fullfact,"The most serious violent and sexual offenders receive automatic early release from prison halfway through their sentence.
","“For the most serious violent and sexual offenders, I’m announcing this Conservative Government will abolish automatic early release at the halfway point. “These criminals will be required to serve two-thirds of their sentence behind bars.” Robert Buckland MP, 1 October 2019 At the Conservative party conference last week, justice secretary Robert Buckland pledged to make it mandatory for the most serious violent and sexual offenders to serve two thirds of their sentence in prison (and not half the sentence as is normal).  The Ministry of Justice told us this would apply to “the most serious sexual and violent offenders where the offence carries a maximum life sentence.” However, to suggest that the most serious criminals are automatically released from prison halfway through their sentences obscures the fact that judges already have discretion to keep serious criminals in prison for longer. There are various sentences a judge can hand down and in most cases sentences are non-custodial (where no time is served in prison). By far the most common sentence for crimes in England and Wales is a fine, but what’s of interest here are sentences which carry mandatory prison time.  Typically in these cases a criminal will be given a standard determinate sentence. This usually requires them to spend half of their sentence in prison and the other half on license in the community, supervised by the probation service. For example, a standard two year sentence would involve one year in prison and one year on license. Being on licence means you can be recalled to prison if you breach the terms of your licence. As well as standard sentences, judges in England and Wales can hand down what are called ‘extended determinate sentences’ to criminals who commit any of over 100 serious offences. The judge can make this decision if: These offenders are either entitled to be released two thirds of the way through their sentence, or can apply for parole at that point. Life sentences work slightly differently. With a life sentence a criminal is required to spend a minimum time in prison and is then able to apply for parole. If they are released, they remain on license for the rest of their life. Compared to existing extended sentences, the Conservatives’ proposal appears to apply to criminals who commit a slightly different group of offences (those that carry a maximum of life rather than this list of serious offences). There is also apparently no requirement for a judge to determine if a criminal poses a risk to the public when giving this new kind of sentence. While the current sentencing procedure does not dramatically change the ability to put serious criminals in prison for two thirds  of their term, it would, in practice, significantly increase the number of criminals receiving two thirds sentences. That’s because judges rarely hand down extended sentences. The Ministry of Justice says that in 2018 there were around 4,000 standard sentences with halfway  release handed down to criminals who committed sexual or violent offences which carry the maximum penalty of life. By comparison, in 2018 judges in England and Wales handed down 398 extended sentences. There is an open question over whether the policy would in fact lead to serious criminals spending more time in prison, because it’s possible that judges could change how they currently sentence. Criminal barrister and author of definitive sentencing guide Banks on Sentence Harry O’Sullivan told us: “The availability of automatic release at the halfway point, rather than the possibility of release on licence after two-thirds, subject to Parole Board approval, is clearly a factor which judges consider when sentencing… “For the proposed policy to have any impact, judges will be required to continue sentencing exactly as before, with no (numerical) regard to the fact that certain offenders would now effectively serve longer. “This would be contrary to the long-trusted principle that the sentencing judge should be afforded broad discretion to determine the fair, just and proportionate sentence in the circumstances. “Some sentencers may feel duty- bound to adjust the numerical sentence they impose to achieve a just result if release eligibility is entirely lifted from the scope of their decision in these cases.”","This is the default sentence (excluding those given life) though judges in England and Wales are already allowed to keep offenders in prison for two thirds of their sentence if they are considered dangerous.

243,fullfact,"More under-18s are being prosecuted for selling cannabis while the number of those aged 18 or over prosecuted has fallen.
","“Police catch 11‑year‑olds being used to sell drugs… More under-18s are being prosecuted for selling the drug [cannabis] even though the number of adult dealers taken to court is falling, a report has shown.” The Times, 12 September 2018 We asked the Times for more information on its figures regarding 11-year-olds—which it obtained through a Freedom of Information request—but it wasn’t able to provide them.   Figures we’ve seen in the past suggest that children of a young age may be selling cannabis, as some as young as 12 are being used to transport drugs around the country. Figures provided to us by the think tank Volteface, which works on alternatives to current drug policies, also suggest this may be the case. Volteface released a report this month looking at children and cannabis. It looked at the change in the level of prosecutions and convictions for the cultivation, possession and supply of cannabis, and of possession with intent to supply over the last five years. It then broke these down by whether the individual involved was under or over the age of 18. Looking at prosecutions, the number of 10-17 year olds prosecuted for supplying cannabis over the last five years has increased, as the Times’ claim states. Although the numbers of people involved are relatively small so small changes can affect how the trend looks a lot. At the same time the number of adults being prosecuted for the same offence fell. Over the five years the number of prosecutions against young people increased by eight (or 15%) while the number against adults fell by almost 100 (or by 16%). Overall many more adults are being prosecuted than children, despite the fall in recent years.  Prosecutions against 10-17 year olds for possession with intent to supply also increased during that time, by 10, or 5%. There were around 690 fewer prosecutions against those aged 18 or over, a decrease of 22%.  The number of people prosecuted for all other cannabis charges fell during that time—regardless of their age. Convictions for children aged 10-17 have increased over the five years for certain cannabis-related offences, such as supply and possession with intent to supply. The number of convictions for supplying cannabis against adults also increased in that time. For all the other offences looked at, the number found of people convicted fell, regardless of their age. Again, the numbers of convictions each year are relatively small, so small changes year-on-year can exaggerate how trends look over time. Between 2012/13 and 2016/17 the number of 10 to 17 year olds convicted of supplying cannabis went up by 11 (or 26%) and the number found guilty of possession with intent to supply increased by eight (or 5%). The number adults found guilty of supplying cannabis aged 18 or over also increased by eight (or by 1%). The figures from Volteface, which originally came from the Ministry of Justice, may not show the complete picture as they only record the main offence that someone was prosecuted for or found guilty of.

The number of 10-17 year-olds prosecuted between 2012/13 and 2016/17 increased, while the number of adults fell. Despite this many more adults are still being prosecuted overall.

Police catch 11 year-olds being used to sell drugs.
","“Police catch 11‑year‑olds being used to sell drugs… More under-18s are being prosecuted for selling the drug [cannabis] even though the number of adult dealers taken to court is falling, a report has shown.” The Times, 12 September 2018 We asked the Times for more information on its figures regarding 11-year-olds—which it obtained through a Freedom of Information request—but it wasn’t able to provide them.   Figures we’ve seen in the past suggest that children of a young age may be selling cannabis, as some as young as 12 are being used to transport drugs around the country. Figures provided to us by the think tank Volteface, which works on alternatives to current drug policies, also suggest this may be the case. Volteface released a report this month looking at children and cannabis. It looked at the change in the level of prosecutions and convictions for the cultivation, possession and supply of cannabis, and of possession with intent to supply over the last five years. It then broke these down by whether the individual involved was under or over the age of 18. Looking at prosecutions, the number of 10-17 year olds prosecuted for supplying cannabis over the last five years has increased, as the Times’ claim states. Although the numbers of people involved are relatively small so small changes can affect how the trend looks a lot. At the same time the number of adults being prosecuted for the same offence fell. Over the five years the number of prosecutions against young people increased by eight (or 15%) while the number against adults fell by almost 100 (or by 16%). Overall many more adults are being prosecuted than children, despite the fall in recent years.  Prosecutions against 10-17 year olds for possession with intent to supply also increased during that time, by 10, or 5%. There were around 690 fewer prosecutions against those aged 18 or over, a decrease of 22%.  The number of people prosecuted for all other cannabis charges fell during that time—regardless of their age. Convictions for children aged 10-17 have increased over the five years for certain cannabis-related offences, such as supply and possession with intent to supply. The number of convictions for supplying cannabis against adults also increased in that time. For all the other offences looked at, the number found of people convicted fell, regardless of their age. Again, the numbers of convictions each year are relatively small, so small changes year-on-year can exaggerate how trends look over time. Between 2012/13 and 2016/17 the number of 10 to 17 year olds convicted of supplying cannabis went up by 11 (or 26%) and the number found guilty of possession with intent to supply increased by eight (or 5%). The number adults found guilty of supplying cannabis aged 18 or over also increased by eight (or by 1%). The figures from Volteface, which originally came from the Ministry of Justice, may not show the complete picture as they only record the main offence that someone was prosecuted for or found guilty of. So if, for example, someone was facing a charge of supplying cannabis, but also a charge of murder, their cannabis charge wouldn’t be recorded in the statistics.","
 
We’ve not seen the evidence for this, though other data on the number of young people prosecuted for drug offences suggests it’s possible.

330,fullfact,"The state is removing more children from their families than at any time since the 1980s.
","“The state is removing more children from their families than at any time since the 1980s” The Economist, 22 March 2018 We don’t know exactly how many children are separated from their parents in England, but it’s clear from available figures that this is likely to be happening to record numbers since the 1980s. To get an idea how many children are being separated, we need to consider how many children are becoming ‘looked after’ by a local authority, and then what happens to them after. Some will return home, while others will be adopted or placed with a guardian. Neither set of figures gives us the full picture: not all children who are in the care of a local authority are actually away from their parents, and not all children who’ve been adopted or placed with another guardian will remain in that situation, as some placements can fall through. In spite of those drawbacks, they still show a clear trend of increasing numbers of children entering the care system, in the care system and being placed with new families. The number of children being “looked after” by their local authority in England is at its highest point since 1984. Published figures we found only go back to 1994, but the Department for Education showed us figures going back to 1966. There were almost 72,700 children being looked after in England in the year ending March 2017. The last time the number was that high was in the year ending March 1984 when there were 74,800. In 1985 this dropped to 69,600 looked after children. Back in 2015, the Department for Education said: “The number of looked after children [in England] has increased steadily over the past seven years and it is now higher than at any point since 1985.”   These figures tell us how many children are in the care system at any one time, but to get a sense of how many are being ‘removed’, we need to look at how many are entering the care system. The number of children who started being looked after in 2017 has also been increasing in recent years, after falling in the early 2000s. There were around 32,800 children who started to be looked after in the year to March 2017. That’s slightly higher now than it was in 1994. We can also take into account population changes when looking at the increase in the number of children being looked after. In 2013 there were 60 children per 10,000 under the age of 18 being looked after, this stayed the same until 2017 when it increased to 62. The definition of being “looked after” is wider than it might sound. Looked after children can include those who are fostered, placed in secure units, children’s homes, or live independently. They can be placed for adoption too, and some are placed with their parents, but with extra supervision from social services. So being under the care of the local authority doesn’t necessarily mean the child has been removed from their parents. 6% of children being looked after at the end of March 2017 were placed with their parents—that’s around 4,370 children. The proportion of children being placed with their parents has stayed roughly the same for at least the last five years. Around three-quarters of children being looked after were in a foster placement in the year ending March 2017. Being fostered can also include placements with relatives or family friends. In most cases the main reason given for a child being looked after by a local authority was abuse or neglect. This was the reason for around 60% of children being looked after by their local council at the end of March each year between 2013 and 2017. Children also leave the care system for a variety of reasons. The number of children who’ve been adopted or placed with a special guardian is likely to be growing, and increasing numbers each year are being placed in this way. In the year ending March 2017, 4,350 looked after children were adopted, which was around 14% of all children who ceased being looked after (around 31,300). Around 3,700, or 11%, were subject to a Special Guardianship Order (SGO). SGOs appoint one or more people who aren’t the child’s parents to become their special guardian. They are legally secure placements which are meant to be permanent, giving guardians parental responsibility but not severing ties between the child and their birth parents in the way adoption can. They came into force late in 2005. If you add together the number of looked after children who stopped being looked after because they were adopted or subjected to an SGO, the figure has more than doubled in roughly the last decade. It went from 3,800 in 2006 to 8,000 in 2017, thanks to an increase in SGOs. Analysis from Community Care shows the numbers being placed on adoption or special guardianship combined much higher in recent years than in the 1990s. The biggest single reason children leave the care system is to return home to live with parents, relatives, or another person with or without parental responsibility. This accounted for about a third of leavers.  17% of children who stopped being looked after in 2017 did so for “any other reason”. According to the Department of Education the majority in that category left care on their 18th birthday. Other reasons for leaving care included moving into independent living with supportive accommodation or being subject to resident or child arrangement orders. Children in foster placements count as being looked after by the local authority, so are not included here. Several possible factors that could have contributed to the increase have been proposed. A local authority might apply for a care order from a court if there are concerns about a child’s welfare. An officer from the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass) represents children in family court proceedings. The tragic death in 2007 of 17 month-old Peter Connelly, known as Baby P, made headlines a year later after his mother, her boyfriend, and his brother were found to have caused or allowed his death. The year after Baby P’s death, a Serious Case Review into what happened was published. Cafcass found that in the direct aftermath of this review, care applications over the following 20 days went up 37% compared to the proceeding 20 days, and were 23% higher than the same period a year before. In 2012 a committee of MPs said this was likely to be the single most important factor behind the increase in the number of children being looked after since then. But it also said that there had already been an increase since July of that year, before the Serious Case Review was published. It also said the increase may have been down to new guidance issued in 2010 that meant local authorities also had to start providing accommodation to 16 and 17 year-olds who are homeless or require accommodation. According to figures provided to us by Cafcass, the number of care applications more than doubled between in the decade up to 2016/17.   Update 4 April 2018  We've updated this article with more information from the Department for Education. Update 8 May 2018  We added a section on the reasons children stopped being looked after, including adoption, special guardianship orders, and returning home to relatives, parents, and people with or without parental responsibility. Correction 8 June 2018  Following feedback about an earlier version of this article, we’ve changed our conclusion and the structure of the piece. The conclusion previously stated there were record numbers of children being looked after by a local authority since the mid-1980s, but that not all of these will have been away from their parents. We’ve expanded this to address children who leave the care system to guardians or adoptive parents, and made clear that the main claim is correct as far as available figures show.","This is correct as far as available figures show. More children are becoming ‘looked after’ by a local authority than at any time since the mid-1980s, and increasing numbers are being adopted or placed with a special guardian. These figures don’t perfectly reflect the numbers of children who are away from their original parents.

More female and black and minority ethnic lawyers were appointed to the senior rank of Queen’s Counsel in 2016/17 than ever before.
","“More female and black and minority ethnic candidates have been appointed Queen’s Counsel than ever before.” Ministry of Justice, 12 January 2017 This headline is correct, but the trend toward more female and ethnic minority appointments to the top rank of the bar is uneven. Queen’s Counsel (QC) is a rank awarded to barristers who are “considered as experts in their field”, as the Bar Standards Board puts it. They generally have a minimum of 15 years' experience. Around 10% of the 17,000 barristers in England and Wales are QCs. In 2016/17, 31 women were successful in their application for QC status, out of 113 in total. There were also 16 new QCs from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. That’s not a record in either category. But it is a record when you add them together. In other words, the number of new QCs who were either female or from a black and ethnic minority background was at its highest ever (ignoring any overlap between the two categories). And there were new records set in each category when you look at the percentages of successful applicants, rather than the absolute numbers. That said, there have been fluctuations within the upward trend. Professor Richard Moorhead, who has also written about this, says that “the most important lessons from the data are probably learnt from the number of applicants and their success rates”. In 2016/17, around one in five applicants for QC status was female, and one in seven from an ethnic minority. Female candidates were more likely than men to be appointed, and ethnic minority candidates roughly the same as white candidates (although this hasn’t always been the case). Professor Moorhead notes that the move toward gender parity at the top levels of the bar is taking time, something also highlighted in today’s headlines: “Fifty years before female QCs reach the top” The Times, 30 January 2017 A report released on 27 January by the Bar Standards Board, a regulator, show that 13.7% of all QCs are female. This is up from 13% in 2015, so the report’s authors comment that at this rate, it would take over 50 years for the proportion of female QCs to reach 50%. Taking the trend from a single year doesn’t necessarily tell us much about what might happen 50 or even 100 years into the future. But the needle has hardly budged over the six years we have data from the Board. In fact, there are fewer female QCs now than there were in 2010. The percentage has held up because the total number of QCs has dropped as well. Non-QC barristers are a lot closer to being representative than the most senior ranks of the profession. Around 39% of non-QCs are female, and over 50% of ‘pupil’ (trainee) barristers. Similarly, the level of ethnic minority representation across all barristers is just below that in the general population. The Bar Standards Board suggests that “the barriers faced by women and BME barristers primarily relate to retention and progression within the profession”. The number of female and ethnic minority QCs is considered important for making judges more diverse, as many of the latter are drawn from the ranks of the former. Correction 2 March 2017 In the graph labelled ""Diversity among top lawyers"", two of the lines were mislabelled. The ""male"" label was attached to the data showing ""white or unknown ethnicity"", and vice versa. That has been corrected in the updated graph. ","
 
Correct, if you add both groups together. Looking at each category individually, there have been more female, and more black and ethnic minority, QCs appointed in previous years.

25,fullfact,"Judges are going to decide on whether the UK will leave the EU.
","“Now you have a situation where you have people in court, at the High Court, to ask this question, which this government never dealt with: does the Prime Minister have the right to use the royal prerogative to trigger Article 50?” Bonnie Greer, 29 September 2016 “You don't seriously believe that a vote of the people of this country, who decided to leave the European Union, should be decided by a judge in chambers…?” Steven Woolfe MEP, 29 September 2016 “He’s not asked to decide it” David Dimbleby, 29 September 2016 The Lord Chief Justice and two other judges will hear a case about the process of leaving the EU in October. They will not be asked to decide whether the referendum vote is valid or not. Ms Greer’s description of the scope of the case is almost textbook. It’s about whether Parliament has to authorise the triggering of Article 50 by passing a law or resolution. If not, the Prime Minister—or perhaps the whole Cabinet—could take the decision without consulting Parliament. But, if the judges decide that the government can’t take the decision alone, that means that starting the process of leaving the EU could be blocked by MPs or Lords. The government is committed to following the referendum result, whereas those in Parliament have differing attitudes to leaving the EU. The referendum had no legal effect in itself. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","The courts will decide whether Parliament has to have a say or not, rather than the government going ahead with Brexit by itself. It’s not directly a question about whether the vote should be upheld, which isn’t a legal matter.

","“Already low percentage of ethnic minority judges FALLS as female numbers flatline” Legal Cheek, 28 July 2016 The percentage of judges that are from ethnic minorities hasn't dropped since last year. The apparent fall shown in the official statistics was down to a change in methodology. Calculating the figure in a consistent way, the proportion has risen slightly.  The percentage of female judges is going up; whether the increase is happening sufficiently quickly, or is desirable in the first place, depends on your point of view. The trend is shown below. In addition to the major methodological change in 2016, there have been some minor changes in how these figures are compiled over the years, but they don’t affect the basic picture. Ethnic minority judges are still rare The percentage of judges from ethnic minorities has risen slightly in the past year, although it's still considerably smaller than the roughly 14% of the population that are ethnic minorities. There were 3,202 judges in England and Wales on 1 April 2016, of which we know the ethnicity of 2,680. Of these 2,680, just 174 identified as being black, Asian or from another ethnic minority. That’s 6.5% of all those who have declared their ethnicity, up from 5.9% in 2015. The reason why the figure appears to have fallen in the official data is because the way the statistics are calculated changed in 2016. In 2015, the number of judges identifying as BAME was calculated as a proportion of only judges with a known ethnicity, and so excludes some 552 judges whose ethnicity was unknown. In 2016, the number of judges identifying as BAME was calculated as a proportion of all judges, including those with an unknown ethnicity. That makes it look as though the percentage has gone down. We're following up with the Courts and Tribunals Judiciary about how this could be made clearer in the statistics. Regardless of methodological changes, the fact that we don’t have data for around 500 or so judges means there is an element of uncertainty here. A separate body of 5,442 judges work in more specialised tribunals rather than in the courts. This group contains more people who identified as BAME, at 9%. The number of female judges has increased, but there aren’t many women in the most senior positions On the face of it, the number of female judges hasn’t flatlined. There were 882 women in post as of 1 April 2016, the highest on record. That’s still only 28% of the total, but the increase from 2015, when it was 25%, continues a clear trend over the past decade. Legal Cheek acknowledges this, but points out that in the upper ranks of the judiciary there has been little movement in the proportion of female judges since 2015. Around one in five High Court and Court of Appeal judges are female, about the same as last year. A decade ago, for context, it was around one in 10. We can look to see whether the number of female judges in line for senior jobs in future is increasing. The Court and Tribunals Judiciary points out that “more than half (51 per cent) of the 85 courts judges under 40 years of age are women”, and two thirds in the specialist tribunals. This is correct, but has to be put in perspective. There were around 8,600 judges in courts and tribunals as of 1 April 2016. Of these, only 243, or 3%, were under 40.  With such a small proportion of under-40s in the judicial ranks, this group is unlikely to have much impact on the overall demographics, even if the hundred or so female judges in this group all progress through the ranks over the years.  Perhaps a more relevant indication of diversity is female representation in what the Lord Chief Justice identified in 2015 as “the two main entry level positions so crucial for the future”. These are Deputy District Judges and Recorders, who work part-time as judges as well as continuing to work as lawyers.  About half of judges in courts fall into one of these two categories. In these posts, women are still a minority and the rate of increase in female representation has been uneven.  Correction 5 September 2016 We originally said that it was correct that the proportion of judges who identify as black, Asian or from another ethnic minority has fallen in the past year. This was based on the percentages given in the time series data published in the official statistics. But this was wrong because the calculation included judges with an unknown ethnicity in 2016, and excluded them in 2015. Calculating the figures in the same way in both years shows the proportion has continued to increase.  Thank you to a reader for raising this issue with us. We are following up with the Courts and Tribunals Judiciary on how the methodological change could be made clearer in future. ","Overall, there has been an increase from 25% in 2015 to 28% in 2016.

This is what the official statistics appear to show, but in fact there has been a slight rise in the proportion of ethnic minority judges compared to 2015. It's now 6.5% of those whose ethnicity is recorded, up from 5.9%. The apparent fall is due to a change in methodology.

289,fullfact,"The latest government reshuffle means the government looks more like the country as a whole.
","""This government is about building a country fit for the future… This reshuffle helps us do just that by bringing fresh talent into government… and ensuring the government looks more like the country it serves."" Theresa May, 9 January 2018 After the government reshuffle this month, the Prime Minister emphasised the diversity of her new government. There are lots of different ways of looking at diversity. We’ve focused here on gender, ethnicity, and educational background as more information is available in these areas. There are more women in the Cabinet, including ministers invited to attend, compared to the previous one appointed by Theresa May in June 2017. There are fewer people from an ethnic minority. The proportion of women and ethnic minority ministers in the Cabinet is lower than in the general UK population. A lower proportion of the new Cabinet, also including other ministers invited to attend, went to a private school than in Theresa May’s first Cabinet appointed in July 2016 (we don’t have the data for June 2017), although the proportion is still much higher than across the UK as a whole. There are six women who are Cabinet Ministers, including the Prime Minster, as of the January 2018 reshuffle. That’s 26% of the Cabinet. The number of women Cabinet Ministers is the same as immediately before the reshuffle, although the proportion has decreased slightly as there is now one more man in the Cabinet. Another four women also attend Cabinet, but aren’t full Cabinet Ministers, bringing the total to ten. Including these, 34% of those attending Cabinet are women. That’s compared to 30%, or eight women, just before the reshuffle. In the June 2017 Cabinet, just after the last election, women made up 26% of Cabinet Ministers and 29% of all those attending Cabinet. The highest-ever proportion of Cabinet Ministers who were women (not including other ministers invited to attend) was 36% (eight Ministers). This was during the Labour government from May 2006 to May 2007. The recent reshuffle also involved junior ministers, who don’t attend Cabinet. We find that 32% of the entire government are women (38). In December 2017, a House of Commons briefing reported that 27% of the government were women (31).   51% of the UK population was estimated to be female in mid-2016. 4.3% of full Cabinet Ministers are from an ethnic minority (or one minister, Sajid Javid, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government). That’s the same number of ministers as just before the reshuffle, although the proportion was slightly higher then, at 4.5%, due to there being one less Cabinet member. The June 2017 Cabinet had two full Ministers from an ethnic minority background—Mr Javid in the same post, and Priti Patel as Secretary of State for International Development. This meant 8.7% of the Cabinet was from an ethnic minority background. This is a smaller proportion than across the rest of the UK. 13% of the UK recorded themselves as something other than “White” in the 2011 Census. The social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust has looked at the educational background of the new Cabinet (including ministers invited to attend). It found that 41% of the Cabinet went to a comprehensive state school, compared to 44% in the Theresa May’s first Cabinet in 2016 (we don’t have more recent analysis than this), and 43% in David Cameron’s 2015 Cabinet. 34% of the 2018 Cabinet were privately educated at secondary school, compared to 30% in July 2016 Cabinet—the Sutton Trust didn’t analyse the Cabinet appointed in June 2017. This is lower than other recent governments. 50% of David Cameron’s 2015 Cabinet were privately educated, and 62% were in the first Coalition Cabinet in 2010. In the first Cabinet of both Tony Blair (1997) and Gordon Brown (2007), the level was 32%, and it was 71% under John Major in 1992. As of January 2017 around 7% of all pupils from nursery to secondary school were privately educated. This proportion has been roughly the same since at least 2003.","Following the January 2018 reshuffle, the government can appear more or less diverse depending on how you look at it. In any case, women and ethnic minorities are underrepresented compared to the UK population, and people educated at private school are overrepresented.

Mr Chisti’s office told us that he was referring to Spencer Stuart’s 2015 report, which also estimated about 5% representation across company boards. Business Insider reports that it drops to 4% if you exclude companies based in “emerging market nations”, although we didn't find this figure in the report itself. This fact check is part of a roundup of Prime Minister's Questions. Read the roundup.","About 5% of directors on FTSE 150 boards which are headquartered or mainly operational in the UK, western Europe, the US, or Australia are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. Only 1.6% are British too, compared to about 13% of the UK population as a whole.

113,fullfact,"The minimum wage should be £18 an hour, because in 1999 one hour’s pay at minimum wage could buy you 72 Freddos, but in 2017 it could only buy you 30 Freddos.
","A post on Facebook claims that the minimum wage should be £18 an hour, because in 1999 one hour’s pay at minimum wage could buy you 72 Freddo chocolate bars, yet in 2017 it could only buy you 30 Freddos. The post is, obviously, light-hearted and not intended to be taken entirely seriously. (We’ve also found what seems to be the original version of the graphic, from Twitter in 2017, which also doesn’t seem to have been posted totally seriously either.) But it’s a good excuse to talk about inflation and chocolate. On a superficial level, the calculation is wrong because Freddos cost 10p in 1999—meaning you could have bought 36 with an hour’s pay on the minimum wage back then, not 72. Both the price of Freddos and the minimum wage have risen faster than inflation in the last two decades. The internet has long revelled in tracking the dramatic rise of the cost of Freddos over time but—just in case you had any doubts about it—the “Freddo Index” isn’t a good measure of inflation. Inflation is the change in prices over time. There’s different ways to measure inflation, but typically it’s calculated by tracking the price of a typical “basket of goods”. So if that basket of goods increases from £100 to £102 over the period of a year, then the rate of inflation is 2%.   And that means that wages need to rise at the same rate (in line with inflation) in order for us to be able to afford to buy the same things in the same amounts. Based on the government’s two official measures of inflation (CPI and CPIH), if a Freddo cost 10p in 1999, and the cost then rose in line with inflation, then a Freddo should have cost 14p in 2017 (an increase of 40%) and 15p today. Yet at the start of 2017 a Freddo cost 25p, and rose to 30p by March (at least in some parts of country—costs seem to vary slightly across the country and between shops). That means that by March 2017 the cost of a Freddo had increased by 200% since 1999—five times faster than inflation.The minimum wage has also risen much faster than the rate of inflation, though. The National Minimum Wage was first introduced in April 1999, and was worth £3.60 per hour for those aged 22 and over. By April 2017, the National Living Wage (which superseded the National Minimum Wage) was worth £7.50 for those aged 25 and over, and £7.05 for those aged 21-14. Had it increased at the rate of inflation, it would have been worth around £5.15 an hour. The structure of the UK minimum wage has changed somewhat over time. In 1999, there were two rates (one for 18-21s and one for those aged 22+). Today there are five rates, covering the age brackets 16-17, 18-20, 21-24, 25+, and a separate rate for apprentices.      This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as satire        because the post is humorous. (Facebook does not currently have a label for humorous or light-hearted content other than satire, so we sometimes use “satire” for things that may not strictly be satirical. We’ve previously called on Facebook to introduce a more appropriate label for such humorous posts.)    ","Actually, you could have got 36 Freddos in 1999. More broadly, Freddos are not a good measure of inflation. The price of Freddos rose about five times faster than inflation from 1999 to 2017, but the minimum wage also rose above inflation in that period.

183,fullfact,"The Bank of England governor says that post-Brexit trade deals could lead to “a golden age of trade”.
","“And will [the Prime Minister] also rule out a future customs union arrangement which would prevent us doing those global trade deals, which the Bank of England governor says is a potential golden age of trade?” Henry Smith MP, 13 February 2019 In Prime Minister’s Questions today Conservative MP Henry Smith said that the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, described post-Brexit trade deals as a potential “golden age of trade”. Except, he didn’t. After a speech at a Financial Times event yesterday, the Sun reported that Mr Carney “admitted Brexit could spark a golden era of trade,” and Mr Smith described the speech in a very similar way in parliament. Mr Carney didn’t use the words “golden age” at all in the speech. While the Sun article didn’t directly quote him as saying that, to describe the speech (which was mostly discussing warning signs of a global economic slowdown) in that way is misleading. On Brexit, Mr Carney actually said: “In many respects, Brexit is the first test of the new global order and could prove the acid test of whether a way can be found to broaden the benefits of openness while enhancing democratic accountability. “Brexit can lead to a new form of international cooperation and cross-border commerce built on a better balance of local and supranational authorities. “In these respects, Brexit could affect both the short and long term global outlooks so it's in the interests of everyone, arguably everywhere […] that a Brexit solution is found that works for all.”","Mr Carney’s speech yesterday did not use these words. It did discuss both opportunities and risks from Brexit, but to describe his comments as suggesting a “golden age of trade” is misleading.

114,fullfact,"Albert Einstein warned in 1949 the time would come when the rich would control the means of communication, making it impossible for ordinary people to make informed decisions.
","A post on Facebook claims that, in 1949, Albert Einstein warned that the time would come “when the very rich so controlled the means of communication that it would be almost impossible for ordinary people to make informed decisions and so democracy would then be broken”. This is a largely accurate summary of an article written by Einstein in 1949. In the inaugural May 1949 edition of socialist magazine Monthly Review, Einstein argued that private capital “tends to become concentrated in few hands”, resulting in “an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society”. “Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). “It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.” The Facebook post suggests that Einstein was warning that this is what would happen in the future, rather than commenting on the present as he was actually doing, but it is still largely correct in its summary of his point.

MPs’ salaries rose from £66,000 in 2010 to £79,500 in 2020.
","A tweet which has been shared 10,000 times has made several claims about how starting salaries for police, teachers, nurses and MPs have changed since 2010.  Some of the numbers are wrong, but it’s correct that MPs’ wages have risen faster than the starting salaries for these other public sector professions. Arguably what’s more important is looking at how far salaries go, by comparing them to the change in prices over time – inflation. While MPs have seen their salaries rise slightly faster than inflation, the other three professions’ starting salaries have not. That means that their pay packets go less far in 2020 than they did in 2010. We have written about this topic before in relation to 2018 pay. You can find that here.  Police  From September 2010, the starting salary for a new police constable was £23,300 in England and Wales. From September 2019, starting pay is £24,200. Factoring in inflation, this amounts to a 14% real-terms reduction in pay.  Not all new constables will start at £24,200. The exact figure depends on skills and experience—those with “no qualifications” can be paid £20,900. This drop-in new starter wage was brought in from April 2013, after recommendations from the Winsor review into police pay and conditions. These wages do not include the London weighting or benefits, like free travel for certain forces. Teachers In 2010, the starting salary for teachers in England and Wales outside of London was £21,600. In 2020, for a newly qualified teacher, the figure is £24,400. Although this seems like a small increase, in real terms, the starting salary has decreased by 6%. This pay scale does not include those in the London area and is for teachers in local authority-run schools. Academies and free schools don’t have to follow the government pay structure, but some chose to anyway. 52% of England’s full-time equivalent qualified teachers work at academies and free schools.  Nurses The tweet makes claims about the change in the average nurse salary, but the figures appear to refer to the change in starting salaries.  When nurses qualify they start on Band 5 of the NHS pay scale. In England, this was £21,200 in 2010 and £24,200 in January 2020. This amounts to a 5% decrease when factoring in inflation. This will rise to £24,900 for 2020/21. Official data on average salaries isn’t published for nurses.  Nurses, along with other NHS staff, received pay rises in 2018. MPs In April 2010, MPs earned £65,700 and from April 2019 have earnt £79,500. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which sets the amount, calculates it based on changes in average earnings in the public sector. Factoring in inflation, this amounts to a 2% increase in real terms. Methodological note To calculate the real-terms change in incomes, we have adjusted wages using the CPIH inflation measure, which includes housing costs. CPI (a similar measure that doesn’t include housing costs) is the inflation measure the government uses to measure inflation for things it tends to pay for (like pension contributions). 2010 salaries have been converted into today’s money using the difference between the most recent inflation index figures (December 2019) and the average index for the period during which the salary band was active.  For example, an MP’s salary was £65,700 between April 2010 and March 2011. During that time, £1 would have bought you the quantity of things that £1.19 would have bought you in December 2019, due to inflation.

The average salary for nurses increased from £22,000 in 2010 to £25,000 in 2020.
","A tweet which has been shared 10,000 times has made several claims about how starting salaries for police, teachers, nurses and MPs have changed since 2010.  Some of the numbers are wrong, but it’s correct that MPs’ wages have risen faster than the starting salaries for these other public sector professions. Arguably what’s more important is looking at how far salaries go, by comparing them to the change in prices over time – inflation. While MPs have seen their salaries rise slightly faster than inflation, the other three professions’ starting salaries have not. That means that their pay packets go less far in 2020 than they did in 2010. We have written about this topic before in relation to 2018 pay. You can find that here.  Police  From September 2010, the starting salary for a new police constable was £23,300 in England and Wales. From September 2019, starting pay is £24,200. Factoring in inflation, this amounts to a 14% real-terms reduction in pay.  Not all new constables will start at £24,200. The exact figure depends on skills and experience—those with “no qualifications” can be paid £20,900. This drop-in new starter wage was brought in from April 2013, after recommendations from the Winsor review into police pay and conditions. These wages do not include the London weighting or benefits, like free travel for certain forces. Teachers In 2010, the starting salary for teachers in England and Wales outside of London was £21,600. In 2020, for a newly qualified teacher, the figure is £24,400. Although this seems like a small increase, in real terms, the starting salary has decreased by 6%. This pay scale does not include those in the London area and is for teachers in local authority-run schools. Academies and free schools don’t have to follow the government pay structure, but some chose to anyway. 52% of England’s full-time equivalent qualified teachers work at academies and free schools.  Nurses The tweet makes claims about the change in the average nurse salary, but the figures appear to refer to the change in starting salaries.  When nurses qualify they start on Band 5 of the NHS pay scale. In England, this was £21,200 in 2010 and £24,200 in January 2020. This amounts to a 5% decrease when factoring in inflation. This will rise to £24,900 for 2020/21. Official data on average salaries isn’t published for nurses.  Nurses, along with other NHS staff, received pay rises in 2018. MPs In April 2010, MPs earned £65,700 and from April 2019 have earnt £79,500. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which sets the amount, calculates it based on changes in average earnings in the public sector. Factoring in inflation, this amounts to a 2% increase in real terms. Methodological note To calculate the real-terms change in incomes, we have adjusted wages using the CPIH inflation measure, which includes housing costs. CPI (a similar measure that doesn’t include housing costs) is the inflation measure the government uses to measure inflation for things it tends to pay for (like pension contributions). 2010 salaries have been converted into today’s money using the difference between the most recent inflation index figures (December 2019) and the average index for the period during which the salary band was active.  For example, an MP’s salary was £65,700 between April 2010 and March 2011. During that time, £1 would have bought you the quantity of things that £1.19 would have bought you in December 2019, due to inflation. So we have calculated £65,700 in 2010 to be worth £78,500 now, by multiplying by 1.19.      This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

124,fullfact,"Boris Johnson is taking £70 a week away from pensioners.
","A Facebook post that has been shared more than 1,000 times claims: “Boris Johnson is taking £70 per week away from pensioners. Meanwhile tax payers contribute £4m to subsidise food and drink in the houses of Parliament for MPs.” Another, shared over 2,000 times, carries a picture of Boris Johnson and says “As a big thank you to the senior citizens who voted for me, I’m going to cut £70 per week from your state pension. The £70 per week allowance for adult dependents is being scrapped from April.” It’s true that a benefit received by around 11,000 pensioners, which is worth up to £70 a week, is being abolished. But the law was passed under Labour over a decade ago. It’s accurate that the total cost of the indirect subsidy to both the House of Commons and Lords catering services is just under £4 million. From 6 April 2020, adult dependency increase (ADI) payments, which some get as part of their pension, will end. In May 2019 this was paid to just under 11,000 pensioners with financially dependent partners and was worth up to £70 a week  . Abolishing ADI was not introduced by Mr Johnson, but was part of reforms set out in the Pensions Act 2007, signed into law under Labour. ADI payments are paid in addition to the state pension, to people with partners who are financially dependent on them, and who are often not yet of pension age. The payments originated in the post-war period, when households with single breadwinners were more usual. The Pensions Act 2007 abolished these payments, and since 6 April 2010 no new claims have been accepted for the payment. Those already in receipt of the money were given another 10 years of the scheme, before it finishes on 6 April 2020. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) confirmed to us that there were 10,817 people in receipt of ADI payments in May 2019 worth up to £70 a week. A DWP spokesperson said that once ADI payments end, those already in receipt of means-tested benefits like Universal Credit or Pension Credit will receive an increase to off-set the loss, while those who do not receive benefits may become eligible to apply for them when they no longer receive ADI. But there are reasons to believe that at least some pensioners who were in receipt of ADI payments may struggle to claim the money in other ways once the payments end. From 15 May 2019, couples who aren’t both over the State Pension age cannot make a new claim for pension credit, unless one is receiving housing benefit for pensioners. Changes to Universal Credit mean a couple where one person is below the State Pension age are considered working-age and will share a standard monthly allowance of £498.89. It can only be claimed if the younger partner is eligible. Steve Webb, who was minister for pensions in the Coalition government from 2010 to 2015  and is a former Liberal Democrat MP, told Full Fact he was “deeply sceptical” that the loss of ADI payments would be offset with other benefits. He said recent changes to pension credit mean any mixed-age couples who were not already receiving the payment “have little chance of claiming it when their income drops £70 a week”, while the Universal Credit rate is “so low” that that they may not “get much even if they qualified”. However, it is not right to suggest all pensioners will be £70 per week worse off, given how few receive this benefit.  One of the Facebook posts also claims that “tax payers contribute £4 million to subside food and drink in the Houses of Parliament for MPs.” This is broadly accurate. We have written before that Parliament’s catering services are not directly subsidised, but they do run at a loss and so public money is effectively spent to subsidise catering overall. (Although this catering is not exclusively for MPs: it is for all parliamentary staff, pass-holders and visitors. In addition to the 650 MPs, there are about 14,500 other pass-holders and an unknown number of visitors who can use the House of Commons catering facilities.) In 2018/19, the House of Commons spent £2.6 million on catering and retail services, while the House of Lords spent £1.2 million, totalling £3.8 million.       This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as partly false        as it is correct that some pensioners will lose as much as £70, but Boris Johnson was not behind the change.    ","Some pensioners will lose £70 a week under reforms introduced in the 2007 Pensions Act. In May 2019 the number receiving this benefit was around 11,000.

","“The employment figures were excellent this week. The lowest unemployment since 1975.”  Nadhim Zahawi MP, 16 November 2017  There were 1.42 million adults unemployed in the UK in the summer of 2017. That’s 4.3% of people aged 16 or over classed as economically active—those either in work or looking for work. It’s correct that the last time the unemployment rate was this low was in 1975.  The unemployment rate varies for different groups of people. For example, the unemployment rate for men is the same as the UK-wide total—4.3% and the lowest since 1975. For women it’s even lower, 4.2% and the joint-lowest it has been since records began in 1971. 11.9% of 16 to 24 year olds (either in work or looking for it) were unemployed during the same period. That figure includes full-time students looking for part-time work. It’s also the lowest it has been since 2004. Unemployment measures people without a job who have been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks, or who have found a job and are waiting to start in the next two weeks. These figures don’t tell us anything about “underemployment”. That’s the number of people seeking more hours, working no more than the maximum weekly working hours already, and able to work more within the next two weeks. We’ve written about this before here.

104,fullfact,"Youth unemployment is down 44% since 2010.
"," “Youth unemployment down 44.2%” Young Conservatives, 17 July 2018 It’s correct that youth unemployment in the UK—in this case people aged 16-24, is down by 44% since 2010, when the Coalition government entered office. That’s about the same fall as seen across employment of all age groups. Just before the 2010 general election there were an estimated 940,000 young people unemployed. That reached over a million in 2011 and 2012, before falling back to today’s estimate of about 520,000. That’s roughly a return to the levels last seen in the early 2000s.  The unemployment rate measures the proportion of people in the jobs market who don’t have one, so it doesn’t count people who aren’t actively seeking work. For people aged 16-24, the unemployment rate has also fallen from 20% at the 2010 election to 12% now. Plenty of young people aren’t even in the jobs market, usually because they’re in full time education, and they aren’t counted against the unemployment rate. You can still be employed if you’re in full time education and you do part time work, although most students don’t.  Out of all young people, 55% are employed, 7% are unemployed and 38% are economically inactive (neither in work nor actively seeking it). Young people are more likely than most to be working part time or in temporary employment, or on a zero-hours contract. That said, the majority of young people aged 16-24 in work have a full time job. Some comments in response to the claim on Twitter say it hides the fact that more young people are staying on in education, so not counting towards the unemployment figures. This isn’t a fair criticism of the situation since 2010, where there hasn't been much movement in the education trends, so the fall in unemployment is genuine. But there is a point here about the longer term. The recession in the late 2000s corresponded with an increase in the proportion of young people in full time education, and the proportion who are economically inactive. Those increases accelerated long-term trends in both measures. Even though the jobs market has recovered since then, those figures haven’t returned to pre-recession levels.   The proportion of young people aged 16-24 who are economically inactive is at near record levels, as is the proportion in full-time education. So the employment figures have been heading in a positive direction, but we haven’t returned to quite the same jobs market we used to have. A NEET is someone not in education, employment or training. Education and training include apprenticeships, government work programmes, people who’ve recently finished job-related training and people enrolled on an education course and are waiting to start or for term to restart. So these figures, broadly, give us a sense of how many young people aren’t involved in the jobs market and aren’t studying or training towards one. They also show a positive direction since 2010 from the government’s perspective. The number of young people aged 16-24 classed as NEET fell from over a million to 800,000 now, or from about 15% of all 16-24 year olds in 2010 to 11% now. But NEETS also look a little different than they used to. In 2010, young people who were NEET were more likely to be actively seeking work (“unemployed”) than economically inactive. That picture has now reversed. Figures from the ONS suggest young people who are economically inactive and NEET are usually looking after a family home, or are long-term sick or disabled. ","Correct.

321,fullfact,"Record numbers of young people are going to university, including more people from disadvantaged backgrounds.    
","“More young people are going to university than ever before, including more young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.” Justine Greening, 27 June 2017 More 18 year olds are going to university than ever before, as are young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Participation by disadvantaged young people has levelled off slightly by some measures in the past year, but the longer term picture is generally one of increasing numbers. Advantaged students are still substantially more likely to go to university than their disadvantaged peers. This piece looks specifically at the numbers of young people going to university, rather than those applying. We’ve covered that in more detail here. In summary, the number of 18 year olds applying to university across the UK was at a record high in 2017. The application rate in England was also at a record high, though it fell in Wales and Northern Ireland. The proportion of people from disadvantaged backgrounds across the UK applying to university is also at a record high, though these figures only go up to January 2017. There were 238,900 18 year olds in the UK accepted onto a full-time university course in 2016, the most ever recorded. This made up around half of all acceptances via UCAS that year. Around 33% of all 18 year olds in England were accepted into a university place in 2016—the highest level recorded. In Wales it was around 30%, again the highest on record. Entry rates for 18 year olds in Northern Ireland rose to 35% in the year to 2016, the same level as 2014.  We haven't mentioned Scotland here because not all universities in Scotland use UCAS and data issues have affected the comparability of Scottish figures over time. Of course, some people wait until they’re 19 before starting university. There’s another set of data that includes these people alongside the 18 year olds who started the year before – what’s called the cohort entry rate. This was also the highest on record in England and Wales in the group entering age 18 in 2015 and age 19 in 2016. This all comes from UCAS data. Separate figures from the government show a similar picture. The government provides data on how many students are living in England who have been in higher education (for the first time) for at least six months and are aged 17-20. This data has the benefit of including part-timers, while the UCAS data relates only to full-time applicants. But it takes a bit longer to get published, so it’s two years behind the UCAS data. The participation rate for this age group was an estimated 41% in 2014/15 (the latest year available), almost the same as it was in 2011/12 when it was the highest on record. The government statisticians say that particularly high participation in 2011/12 “appears to have been predominantly driven by more students choosing not to defer entry in that year in order to avoid having to pay a higher tuition fee”. Using the same measure the participation rate for 18 year olds in 2014/15 was 26%, the highest on record and just above what it was in 2011/12. In 2016 the entry rate for 18 year olds living in the most disadvantaged areas increased for all countries in the UK. It increased to the highest on record in England (almost 20%) and Wales (18%). In Northern Ireland it was at 16%, the second highest recorded level. Disadvantage here is measured according to the rate of participation in higher education by young people in each area, so the most disadvantaged areas are those with the lowest rates of participation by young people. The rate for those in the most advantaged areas in 2016 increased slightly to 46% in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. The cohort entry rates (available only for England), show the gap between young people from the most disadvantaged areas and the most advantaged areas going to university is decreasing.  UCAS have also released a new ‘multiple equality measure’ (MEM), for the first time for 2016. This looks at things like gender, ethnic group, where a person lives, the type of school they go to, and if they got free school meals. Based on a combination of these factors 18 year olds are placed into one of five groups ranging from most to least disadvantaged. On this measure all five groups have seen growing participation rates, and reached record highs in 2016. That said, the participation rate for the most disadvantaged group has increased more slowly than that of the other groups over the last two years.  Disadvantage can also be measured by income level, typically measured by whether or not a young person was receiving free school meals at age 15. The entry rate to university of 18 year old state school pupils in receipt of free school meals was also at a record high in 2016—at about 16%. That's compared to almost 33% for those who didn’t receive free school meals. The equivalent government measure (which looks at entry to university by age 19) showed a slightly different picture when Ms Greening made her comments. By this measure there was a slight fall in the proportion of pupils receiving free school meals who had gone to university by 2013/14. It decreased by one percentage point to 22%. This decrease was also seen among those not receiving free school meals, so it didn’t change the gap between the two.  The government told us that it can’t say whether or not the introduction of higher tuition fees had an impact on the dip in entry rates for students receiving free school meals who attended university by 2013/14—the first cohort of 18 and 19 year olds to be affected. Newer figures have become available since which show that this seems to have been a temporary effect and that overall the proportion of people who received free school meals and attend university by the age of 19 is increasing. It was 24% for those attending university by 2014/15. Update 22 September 2017  We updated this article with new information from the Department for Education, after seeking clarification on its view on whether higher tuition fees had contributed to the dip for the 2013/14 FSM cohort going to university. Previously we were told that there was no evidence the increased tuition fees had an impact. ","Mostly correct at the time, and now correct on all measures. Some figures produced by government statisticians showed a slight dip in the proportion of disadvantaged students attending university when the claim was made. Newer data now suggests that this was temporary and that the longer term picture is one of generally increasing numbers.

150,fullfact,"German TV said there were 2.2 million people at the People’s Vote march on Saturday 19 October.
","After the People’s Vote march on Saturday 19 October, tweets claiming that there were either two million or 2.2 million people on the march went viral. The viral claims say that the figure of two million was reported by Sky News, and that the figure of 2.2 million came from “German TV”. The three most widely shared tweets reporting one or both of these numbers—including one from Alastair Campbell, and another from TechCrunch editor-at-large Mike Butcher—have over 8,000 retweets between them. There is no evidence of either Sky News or German TV reporting these figures. Crowd scientists at Manchester Metropolitan University have told us that 2 million is an implausible estimate.  The first reference we’ve seen linking the numbers to Sky and German TV came from a tweet posted by an anonymous account at 3.54pm on the day of the march, which referred to those figures being from the “last march”. The same tweet was also identified by Professor Tanja Bueltmann of Northumbria University, who wrote about her attempts to find a source for the figures. Since then, hundreds of other tweets have repeated the same claims. None of the tweets we have seen gave a source for the claims—even, as Professor Bueltmann points out, after being asked to do so.  The “German TV” station supposedly behind the claim is not identified in any of the tweets we’ve seen. However, of the major German television news stations or programmes, Tagesschau reported the march as having “hundreds of thousands” of participants, as did n-tv. Deutsche Welle opted for “tens of thousands”, as did ZDF, while Welt simply opted for “thousands”. None of them mention any higher estimate from a rival. We also can’t find any major German non-television news outlet reporting the figure. Die Zeit said “hundreds of thousands”, as did Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Bild said hundreds of thousands were expected, Süddeutsche Zeitung reported the organisers’ claim of one million, as did Die Tageszeitung. Journalist Mike Butcher claims to have explained the methodology behind the supposed German TV estimate of 2.2 million. While his explanation is undoubtedly a methodology (which we have not verified), he still does not provide any evidence that this methodology was used by German TV, or that German TV made an estimate of 2.2 million in the first place. Sky News also reported the figure as “hundreds of thousands”. We asked Sky News if it reported a figure of two million. They told us that they had not produced their own official estimate of the crowd size, although it’s possible that their coverage may have reported on a claim that the crowd size was that large. We haven’t been able to find any reference to the figure in Sky’s online coverage. We spoke to crowd science experts at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU). Their calculations show it is implausible that 2 million people could have attended the march. They used two separate methods which both produced estimates in the low hundreds of thousands at most. They said a more precise estimate would require more time and analysis. Firstly they estimated the overall average crowd density of the entire march area to have been 1.5-3 people per square metre, based on aerial footage of the march. The images below illustrate a density of 2 and 3 people per square metre respectively. Given that the total area occupied by the crowd was observed at around 70,000 square metres, that means a crowd of between 105,000 and 210,000 people could have fitted along the total area of the route at any given time (though some more may have been in side streets and nearby areas). This doesn’t cover the assembly area on Park Lane (which, aerial footage shows, was fairly empty at the height of the march). Even if you included it, the total march area would be roughly double, giving a capacity of around 200-400,000 people based on the observed crowd density—still well below 2 million. Another way MMU estimated the total crowd size was to work out how many people could have passed through the official march route, over the course of its duration. This method acknowledges that crowds are fluid with people arriving and departing at different times To do this you need to look at flow through the narrowest point of a march, which MMU measured to be 20 metres wide. They told us that you could expect around 1,000-1,200 people to pass through that point every minute (based on a crowd density of four people per square metre—the safe limit in most situations). Given that the march lasted 180 minutes, that gives a theoretical maximum capacity of 216,000 people walking along the march route over its total duration (1,200 people multiplied by 180 minutes). Again, this doesn’t factor in people who might not have walked the official route, and the fact that the event did not come to a sudden halt after three hours exactly. But the march would have had to carry on for over 30 hours to fit a crowd of two million people along the official route. Based on the weight of evidence, the crowd at Saturday’s march was likely in the low-to-mid hundreds of thousands and certainly not in the millions. Update 22 October 2019  This piece was updated to include estimates and comment from crowd scientists at Manchester Metropolitan University.","We’ve seen no evidence any German TV station said this. All the reporting we’ve seen from German TV and other news media outlets put the number in the tens or hundreds of thousands.

Sky News said there were 2 million people at the People’s Vote march on Saturday 19 October.
","After the People’s Vote march on Saturday 19 October, tweets claiming that there were either two million or 2.2 million people on the march went viral. The viral claims say that the figure of two million was reported by Sky News, and that the figure of 2.2 million came from “German TV”. The three most widely shared tweets reporting one or both of these numbers—including one from Alastair Campbell, and another from TechCrunch editor-at-large Mike Butcher—have over 8,000 retweets between them. There is no evidence of either Sky News or German TV reporting these figures. Crowd scientists at Manchester Metropolitan University have told us that 2 million is an implausible estimate.  The first reference we’ve seen linking the numbers to Sky and German TV came from a tweet posted by an anonymous account at 3.54pm on the day of the march, which referred to those figures being from the “last march”. The same tweet was also identified by Professor Tanja Bueltmann of Northumbria University, who wrote about her attempts to find a source for the figures. Since then, hundreds of other tweets have repeated the same claims. None of the tweets we have seen gave a source for the claims—even, as Professor Bueltmann points out, after being asked to do so.  The “German TV” station supposedly behind the claim is not identified in any of the tweets we’ve seen. However, of the major German television news stations or programmes, Tagesschau reported the march as having “hundreds of thousands” of participants, as did n-tv. Deutsche Welle opted for “tens of thousands”, as did ZDF, while Welt simply opted for “thousands”. None of them mention any higher estimate from a rival. We also can’t find any major German non-television news outlet reporting the figure. Die Zeit said “hundreds of thousands”, as did Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Bild said hundreds of thousands were expected, Süddeutsche Zeitung reported the organisers’ claim of one million, as did Die Tageszeitung. Journalist Mike Butcher claims to have explained the methodology behind the supposed German TV estimate of 2.2 million. While his explanation is undoubtedly a methodology (which we have not verified), he still does not provide any evidence that this methodology was used by German TV, or that German TV made an estimate of 2.2 million in the first place. Sky News also reported the figure as “hundreds of thousands”. We asked Sky News if it reported a figure of two million. They told us that they had not produced their own official estimate of the crowd size, although it’s possible that their coverage may have reported on a claim that the crowd size was that large. We haven’t been able to find any reference to the figure in Sky’s online coverage. We spoke to crowd science experts at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU). Their calculations show it is implausible that 2 million people could have attended the march. They used two separate methods which both produced estimates in the low hundreds of thousands at most. They said a more precise estimate would require more time and analysis. Firstly they estimated the overall average crowd density of the entire march area to have been 1.5-3 people per square metre, based on aerial footage of the march. The images below illustrate a density of 2 and 3 people per square metre respectively. Given that the total area occupied by the crowd was observed at around 70,000 square metres, that means a crowd of between 105,000 and 210,000 people could have fitted along the total area of the route at any given time (though some more may have been in side streets and nearby areas). This doesn’t cover the assembly area on Park Lane (which, aerial footage shows, was fairly empty at the height of the march). Even if you included it, the total march area would be roughly double, giving a capacity of around 200-400,000 people based on the observed crowd density—still well below 2 million. Another way MMU estimated the total crowd size was to work out how many people could have passed through the official march route, over the course of its duration. This method acknowledges that crowds are fluid with people arriving and departing at different times To do this you need to look at flow through the narrowest point of a march, which MMU measured to be 20 metres wide. They told us that you could expect around 1,000-1,200 people to pass through that point every minute (based on a crowd density of four people per square metre—the safe limit in most situations). Given that the march lasted 180 minutes, that gives a theoretical maximum capacity of 216,000 people walking along the march route over its total duration (1,200 people multiplied by 180 minutes). Again, this doesn’t factor in people who might not have walked the official route, and the fact that the event did not come to a sudden halt after three hours exactly. But the march would have had to carry on for over 30 hours to fit a crowd of two million people along the official route. Based on the weight of evidence, the crowd at Saturday’s march was likely in the low-to-mid hundreds of thousands and certainly not in the millions. Update 22 October 2019  This piece was updated to include estimates and comment from crowd scientists at Manchester Metropolitan University.","
 
We’ve seen no evidence it said this. It reported the figure as “hundreds of thousands”.

166,fullfact,"The maximum weekly state pension is £141 in the UK, £507 in Germany, £304 in France, and £513 in Spain.
","An image claiming that French, German, and Spanish maximum weekly state pensions are between double and triple those in the UK has been shared around 11,000 times on Facebook at the time of writing.  The figures for the UK, Spain and France are in the right ballpark, but differences between their pension systems means it’s not a fair comparison. Germany doesn’t have a maximum amount for its state pension. Compared to these other countries, the UK state pension is essentially a flat rate with the exact amount dependent on years of contributions and age. Spanish, German and French pensions are calculated using more complex formulas that depend on previous earnings, so their maximum weekly pensions appear higher as those would be for the countries’ higher earners. Many UK workers pay into additional non-compulsory workplace pensions as well, and those are dependent on earnings. The figures in this viral image have appeared in the media before, albeit in annual terms. We think they originate from a table in a Which? article published in 2013. It’s no longer online, but Which? provided us with a copy. The table cites the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Social Security Association (ISSA) as sources. The OECD told us it was not the source of the monetary figures. We’ve asked the ISSA for more information as we can’t find the exact figures the table refers to. The EU collects data on social security in 32 countries, including information on pension systems and payments. As of January 2018, it reported that Spain had a minimum means-tested pension, which works out at around £155 a week for a single person, while the maximum possible is around £535 a week. The minimum French pension is £130 a week and the maximum is around £340 a week. In Germany, most workers’ pension insurance payments are compulsory but there is no statutory minimum, maximum or full pension. The full state pension in the UK is now between £125 and £165 a week, depending on when you were born and your national insurance contributions. This doesn’t include any additional state pension, pension credit, or other benefits a pensioner might be eligible for. As well as the pensions schemes discussed above, France, Spain and Germany all have safety net social assistance payments for the elderly, where income and assets are taken into account so poorer pensioners get more. The OECD last collected this information in all four countries for the year 2016. Using the 2016 exchange rate, this type of payment could top up pensioners’ income to around £150 a week in France and Germany, and £80 a week in Spain. The OECD told us these amounts are comparable to pension credit in the UK, which is an income-related benefit that (in 2016) could top up a single pensioner’s weekly income to £155 a week if their state pension and other earnings were below that. For 2015/16, the government estimates that 40% of families eligible for pension credit weren’t claiming it, leaving up to £3.3 billion of available pension credit unclaimed. So in this respect, UK pensioners can expect slightly more money from the government than their European counterparts, although comparing gross figures doesn’t take into account different average incomes and cost of living in these four countries. Comparing each country’s social assistance payments with the UK’s pension credit, doesn’t take into account the range of financial benefits available to UK pensioners. Winter fuel payments (between £100 and £300), free prescriptions, and free TV licences for the over 75s (worth £150.50 a year) are some of the subsidies offered to pensioners in the UK. The OECD also looks at how different income sources contribute to the average pensioners’ total earnings. Out of the four countries being compared in the viral image, the proportion of pensioners’ earnings from publically provided benefits is the smallest in the UK, at just 43%. In France, Germany and Spain, it’s closer to 70%. Occupational transfers, like a private workplace pension, make up 30% of older people’s earnings in the UK, compared to 5% in Germany and a negligible amount in Spain and France.  Another measure gives pension entitlement as a percentage of pre-retirement average earnings, and takes into account income taxes and social security contributions. In 2017 the OECD said this figure was 82% for Spain, 75% in France, 51% in Germany and 29% for the UK. These figures have also been made into a viral image. People are able to retire at 65 in the UK and Spain right now, although that’s set to shift to 67 in both countries. In France the retirement age is 62. The statutory retirement age is in the process of moving from 65 to 67 in Germany.","The figures for the UK, Spain and France are in the right ballpark, but differences between their pension systems means it’s not a fair comparison. Germany doesn’t have a maximum amount for its state pension.

The closest match we found in the past was this table from a Which? article published in 2013. This shows figures very close to the ones in the Facebook post (but in annual terms rather than weekly). Both the OECD and the International Social Security Association (ISSA), are cited as the source of the numbers. The OECD told us    they were not the source of the monetary figures, and the ISSA told us the figures didn’t seem to be sourced from them directly. Comparing pensions between countries “is complicated by substantial differences in the structure of pension systems across the developed world”, according to a recent House of Commons Library analysis. Some comparative figures can give the impression that UK pensioners are considerably worse off in retirement than those in other advanced economies. That’s because UK pensioners get a much higher proportion of their retirement income from occupational pensions or personal savings, as opposed to state pensions and benefits.     When you just look at public pensions and benefits, UK pensions are considerably lower than those of other major advanced economies. All the countries listed in the graphic generally have higher public spending on old-age pensions as a proportion of GDP (the size of their economies) than the UK does    . Using figures for 2015, the equivalent of 5.2% of UK GDP went into public spending on pensions, compared to 7.7% in Spain, 7.9% in Germany and 12.1% in France. Those figures are just counting pensions and benefits provided by the state, not occupational pensions or voluntary savings people make. But that’s only one part of what people get through a pensions system. It doesn’t properly factor in how people’s lifetime earnings can affect their pension entitlements. The OECD measures what’s called a “pension replacement rate”—which broadly speaking expresses what pensioners receive relative to their previous earnings when working. UK pensions are relatively low on this measure as well. If you just consider mandatory public and private pensions, an average UK pensioner’s income is worth 29% of their earnings at retirement, compared to 51% in Germany, 75% in France and 82% in Spain. But pensions in both the UK and Germany tend to get top-ups from voluntary pensions, which pushes their ratios to 62% for the UK and 65% for Germany when included (with the other countries staying the same).     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as mixture        because the figures are in the right ball park but the pension systems differ so widely that it’s not a fair comparison.    ","The figures for the UK, Spain and France are in the right ballpark in terms of the maximum available in each country, but differences between their pension systems means it’s not a fair comparison.

204,fullfact,"The UK paid out £674 million in health costs to European countries, but received only £49 million in return. Addressing this could “transform the financial situation of the NHS”.
"," A post circulating on Facebook makes claims about how much the UK pays out to other EU countries for health costs incurred by UK citizens abroad. These figures are broadly correct for 2015. The discrepancy is partly due to how the NHS recoups the money it is owed, but also partly because the costs of treating UK citizens abroad are high in comparison to the costs of treating European citizens in the UK. The amounts involved are relatively small compared to the overall NHS budget, so the claim that changing this “in itself would transform the financial situation of the NHS” is exaggerated.  Health charities have said that the NHS in England needs an extra £4 billion just to stop services getting worse. Even if the UK Government recouped all of the money it is entitled to, this would represent a funding increase of just 7% of this amount. The UK Government reimburses other European Economic Area countries and Switzerland for the cost of providing treatment to people it is responsible for under European Union law, irrespective of nationality. In the same way, other EEA countries and Switzerland reimburse the UK for the cost of the NHS providing treatment to people they are responsible for under EU law, including UK nationals insured in another EEA country or Switzerland. The European Economic Area is the 28 European Union countries, plus Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein. Switzerland is not a member of the EU or the EEA, but is closely tied to these countries through a series of treaties. The UK also has a series of reciprocal healthcare agreements with countries outside of Europe. In 2015, EEA countries and Switzerland claimed against the NHS for over £674 million of costs of treating people from the UK overseas. In the same year, the NHS claimed for £50 million of equivalent costs for treating EEA and Swiss citizens in the UK. These figures are taken from a response to a written question from the Department for Health in England to John Mann MP in 2016, and refer to 2015. Mr Mann then wrote about this issue on his website. Health is a devolved subject, meaning that generally speaking it is dealt with separately by the UK, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Governments. However, UK Government guidance  makes it clear that EEA and Switzerland cost recovery programmes are managed by the English Department for Health on behalf of the whole of the UK. The Nuffield Trust has looked at the links between EU membership and the funding of the NHS. They noted that there is a large discrepancy between the treatment costs claimed by and against the NHS: ""The size of the difference between the amount the UK pays out and the amount it receives is partly because foreign citizens in Britain run up less than half as many costs which might be covered under these schemes as British citizens abroad. However, government studies suggest that the NHS is also simply failing to charge when it is supposed to – recouping only a fraction of what should be around £340m from other countries.""  In short, British people abroad run up more health care costs than do EEA and Swiss people in the UK. As the NHS’s Paul MacNaught told the Commons Health Committee, this is largely a consequence of “the volume of UK insured pensioners living in other EEA countries compared with the volume of EEA insured pensioners living here.” There is a strong cross-over between countries where large numbers of UK pensioners live abroad and the amount of money countries claim from the NHS for treating British citizens.  Added to this is the fact that the NHS does not seek as many costs as it could for treatment of EEA and Swiss people in UK hospitals. The UK Government has said that cost recovery is poor because the NHS struggles to identify patients whose treatment costs it can recover under this scheme. This means that the UK is unable to invoice the appropriate country for the costs of treatment. The Government has been trying to improve this process. A 2017 evaluation of this work said that there had been “good progress towards increasing cost recovery from EEA patients, although this has slowed significantly”. The UK Government has estimated that it could recoup £290 million more for treatment of EEA and Swiss citizens, taking the total to £340 million. However, in 2017, the Nuffield Trust, The King’s Fund and the Health Foundation said that the NHS in England needed an extra £4 billion just to stop services getting worse. This figure doesn’t include the funding needs in the other nations of the UK. If the NHS were to recoup an additional £290 million for treatment of EEA and Swiss citizens, this would represent a funding increase of 7% of this amount. To put this figure into some context, the total budget of the NHS in England in 2018-19 is £126 billion. It is hard to see how this change could therefore “in itself transform the financial situation of the NHS”. -- Robin Wilkinson is a Senior Research Officer from the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, on secondment with Full Fact Update 30 April 2019  We updated this piece to clarify in the conclusion that the claim is based on figures for 2015.","The figures are broadly correct for 2015, although addressing this situation would in itself only have a marginal impact on the financial situation of the NHS.

205,fullfact,"Health tourism costs 0.3% of NHS spending.
","“So-called 'health tourism' costs just 0.3% of NHS spending”. Mirror, 23 November 2016 It’s difficult to put a figure on exactly how much “health tourism” costs the NHS. 0.3% reflects the upper end of the government’s rough estimates of “deliberate health tourism” and visitors “taking advantage” of the system. Who is a “health tourist”? Qualifying for free NHS care isn’t based on nationality or where someone was born. It’s based on whether you are “ordinarily resident” in the UK and the type of treatment you need. The government estimates that normal use of the NHS, by people who aren’t “ordinarily resident”, but who don’t come to the UK specifically to use the NHS, is around £1.8 billion a year. This can include holiday makers who injure themselves while in the UK or someone who gets sick while in the UK for work temporarily. When it made this estimate in 2012/13 the government said it thought that about £190 million of this figure could be charged directly to patients and another £220 million charged to European Economic Area (EEA) countries under the European Health Insurance Card scheme. Deliberate health tourism means those who come to the UK deliberately to use NHS services they’re not entitled to for free. Those taking advantage of the system are those who frequently come to the UK and are able to use GP services and other treatments like prescriptions. This could even include British expats who return to the UK to see a trusted doctor. It is this group the Mirror refers to when it says that health tourism costs 0.3% of NHS spending. What does it cost? The government has estimated that treating deliberate health tourists and those taking advantage costs around £100 to £300 million a year. Those are incredibly rough figures. At the moment there are some services which, no matter whether you are “ordinarily resident” or not, you can’t be charged for. The costs estimated by the government also include these services, like going to see a GP or using Accident and Emergency. So even if the NHS charged for all the services it possibly could and received the money, it wouldn’t cover the full amount health tourism is estimated to cost. So how does that compare to overall NHS spending?  The Mirror compared the upper estimate of £300 million spent on deliberate health tourism and those taking advantage to the £91.5 billion allocated to specific NHS services in 2012/13. That’s just over 0.3%. There hasn’t been a thorough analysis of the costs of health tourism more recently so we can’t say whether or not this proportion spent on deliberate health tourism has changed. Looking at this another way, the upper estimate for the cost of deliberate health tourism would be around £311 million in 2015/16 prices. Assuming this figure is still roughly the same then that would have been around 0.31% of the total NHS budget for that year and 0.27% of the Department of Health’s total budget. This isn’t a particularly accurate measure—we’ve just used GDP growth as a basis for inflation here— but it gives a rough idea of the cost of “deliberate health tourism” and services used by those “taking advantage”. What can be recovered? The government aims to recover £500 million a year by 2017/18 from all patients not eligible for free treatment on the NHS. In 2015/16 it charged £289 million, although we don’t know how much of this it received. It has also predicted that it won’t meet the 2017/18 aim and will charge £346 million that year. From April 2015, non-EEA citizens who come to the UK for longer than six months as students or temporary migrants have been required to pay a “health surcharge” as part of their visa process. This allows them to access NHS care free of charge during their stay in the UK. Most of the increase in NHS charging in 2015/16 came from this. We’ve written about the costs of health tourism before.","The government’s estimate of how much ""deliberate health tourism"" and those taking advantage of free NHS services cost the NHS every year was around 0.3% of NHS spending allocated to specific services in 2012/13. It’s still roughly around 0.3% of total health spending.

Recovering the costs of health tourism won’t plug the funding gap the NHS is facing.

151,fullfact,"Remaining in the EU means £50 billion more for the government to spend by 2024/25.
","“We know that that remain bonus will be £50 billion that we can spend on our public services, investing in our schools and in the welfare system to help poorest in our society”. Jo Swinson, 5 November 2019 Yesterday saw a lot of press coverage of a claim by the Liberal Democrats that remaining in the EU would mean UK GDP was 1.9% larger by 2024/25, and that this would generate a “remain bonus” of £50 billion for the government to spend. The “remain bonus” was also mentioned by Jo Swinson in the Lib Dems’ campaign launch speech. We’ve checked the Lib Dems’ calculations and they seem a reasonable assessment of the best available forecasts we have on how the economy could be affected by different Brexit scenarios. That said, the numbers still come with a health warning. Experts, whose research the Lib Dems used, emphasise that projections like this are subject to a large degree of uncertainty. It’s far too early to categorically say—as Jo Swinson did—that “we know that that remain bonus will be £50 billion that we can spend on public services”. The Liberal Democrats shared their calculations with us. They produced estimates of how much UK GDP would grow by over five years in a Brexit deal scenario, and in a scenario where we remained in the EU. This was based largely on analysis from the independent think tank Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and Citi Bank. The Lib Dems found that, based on their calculations, GDP would be 1.9% higher in a Remain scenario than under a Brexit scenario. They then calculated how much higher GDP growth under Remain might translate into extra income for the government (known as public sector receipts)—through things like more revenue from taxes. GDP is the value of all goods and services produced in a country; it’s expected to grow in both the Remain and Brexit deal scenarios, but by more in the former. The Lib Dems have looked at what public sector receipts are expected to be, as a percentage of GDP, over the next few years, to estimate how much more the UK government would have in its account each year in the Remain scenario—where GDP is higher overall—than in the Brexit deal scenario. This works out at just over £50 billion over the next five years or—on average—£10 billion each year. While this doesn’t seem to have factored in inflation, even when you do it still works out at around £50 billion. The Lib Dems also said that their calculations factored in the fact that in a Remain scenario the UK would have to continue paying its EU membership fee. The Lib Dems argue that this additional money could be put into public spending. For context, total UK public spending is expected to be £824 billion in 2019/20, so this hypothetical “remain bonus” is a relatively small in comparison. Paul Johnson, Director of the IFS, said of the Lib Dems’ calculation: ""We could expect the economy to be bigger if we were to remain and this assumes a relatively modest effect if anything, although obviously subject to a huge amount of uncertainty"". The uncertainty point is important. GDP growth can be affected by a number of factors both global and domestic. The IFS and Citi call their growth estimates “potential paths for the UK economy” and point out that things like different election outcomes could change those paths. The IFS told us that if, for example, a decision to remain in the EU was followed by intense political pressure to leave or have another referendum, this could create more economic uncertainty and affect GDP. So the Lib Dems’ £50 billion figure is a reasonable indication of what additional money a government might have to spend over the next five years, if we remain in the EU compared to if we leave with a deal. However, it’s important to remember that the calculation is based on projections of GDP growth which themselves are highly uncertain, and so it’s far from definitive. Correction 6 February 2020  We corrected the date on which Jo Swinson made this claim to clarify it was in 2019.","This is a fair assessment of the best available forecasts, comparing Remain to a Brexit deal scenario. But those forecasts themselves contain a high degree of uncertainty, so we shouldn’t treat £50 billion as definitive.

70,fullfact,"Britons have spent £4bn stockpiling goods in case of no-deal Brexit.
","“Britons have spent £4bn stockpiling goods in case of no-deal Brexit” The Guardian, 12 August 2019 On Monday, a number of media outlets reported that Britons have spent £4 billion on stockpiling goods in case of a no deal Brexit. But this is almost certainly an exaggeration. The survey it’s based on likely overestimates the amount that has been stockpiled, and consumer spending data shows no evidence of people stockpiling to this degree. We can’t definitively say this amount of stockpiling hasn’t occurred, but there are very strong reasons to be sceptical. The finding comes from a survey conducted by the research company Consumer Intelligence, on behalf of the finance provider Premium Credit. The press release says Consumer Intelligence surveyed a representative sample of 1,052 adults in the UK, and found that 20% had stockpiled goods in preparation for Brexit. (It didn’t specify in preparation for a no deal Brexit). It calculated that this meant around ten million Britons have stockpiled for Brexit, based on the total adult population of the UK being just over 52 million. The survey also found that, among those who had stockpiled, the average amount stockpiled was £380. They multiplied this figure by the roughly ten million people they estimated to have stockpiled across the country, to come up with the £4 billion figure. There is a problem with this calculation. In extrapolating the survey findings to work out the total amount stockpiled the general population, Consumer Intelligence used the total number of UK adults rather than the total number of households. In doing this, it’s likely that Consumer Intelligence overestimated the amount Britons are stockpiling. That’s because there is a strong likelihood that people responded to the survey on behalf of their household, rather than themselves as an individual. To illustrate this, imagine you live with a partner and together you’ve stockpiled £400 worth of food. If a survey asks you how much you’ve stockpiled, you’d probably say £400, rather than working out your individual share of £200. It seems likely that at least some—and probably most— respondents would report a household figure rather than their individual sum. So Consumer Intelligence’s data is likely to more accurately represent the amount the average household had stockpiled, rather than the average individual. If it does indeed reflect household stockpiling, it would have been more appropriate to use the total number of households to extrapolate the findings to the national level, rather than the total number of UK adults. Overall, there are around 28 million households in the UK. We know that Consumer Intelligence’s extrapolation is based off the figure of 52 million adults. So if even a minority of respondents reported a household figure rather than an individual figure, the extrapolation could have considerably overestimated the total amount stockpiled in the country. We cannot know for certain if this has happened, as we haven’t seen the original survey results. But based on what we’ve seen of the methodology, and the fact that respondents were asked ‘how much have you spent on stockpiling’, it seems likely that this problem has affected the results. (This section has been updated.) The press release reporting Consumer Intelligence’s findings stated that the survey was based on “1,052 consumers in the UK currently in employment”. We pointed out in the original version of this article that this would mean that the findings could not be representative of the UK as a whole, because they did not survey anyone who was unemployed or retired. We also stated that it was reasonable to expect that the stockpiling habits of unemployed and retired people might differ to those of employed people. Since we first published the article, we’ve been told that there was an error in the original press release, and that the survey did in fact include retired and unemployed people and is representative of the UK as a whole. It remains unclear why much of the media coverage of the story referred to the £4 billion figure as the total amount stockpiled by “Britons” or “Brits” when the wording of the original press release suggested that the findings could not be representative of the UK as a whole. If such a high level of stockpiling were occurring, you’d expect that to show up in consumer spending data. We asked the British Retail Consortium, which compiles a monthly measure of UK retail sales, whether it had seen any evidence of people stockpiling in preparation for Brexit. Andrew Opie, Director of Food & Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: “We’re not seeing evidence of individual stockpiling in sales and there’s no need for consumers to do so. Retailers have increased stocks of longer life products we typically buy to cope with any disruption. The biggest problem in a no deal Brexit is fresh fruit and vegetables where supplies are likely to be disrupted and it’s impractical for anyone to stockpile.”   Update 19 August 2019  We’ve updated the article to explain the evolution of the story. In the original version of this article, we stated that Consumer Intelligence’s findings could not be representative of the UK, based on the fact that their press release said the survey was of “1,052 consumers in the UK currently in employment”, meaning it excluded unemployed and retired people. The team in charge of the press release have since told us that there was an error in the original press release, and the findings are in fact representative of the UK as a whole, including those who are retired and unemployed.","This is almost certainly an exaggeration. The survey it’s based on likely overestimates the amount that has been stockpiled, and consumer spending data shows no evidence of people stockpiling to this degree.

184,fullfact,"The EU has decided to increase the size of fisherman’s meshes.
","Ann Widdecombe, a Brexit Party MEP, made the following claim during her maiden speech in the European Parliament. “The powers that be have decided to actually increase the size of fishermen’s meshes thereby reducing their income by 40%.” Ann Widdecombe, 4 July 2019 The EU Commission has changed some fishing regulations, which came into force on 1 July 2019, which does include introducing a minimum size of fishing mesh in certain areas. The claim that this will reduce fishermen’s incomes by 40% is based on a quote from an unknown source on a Cornish local news website. We asked the Brexit Party where the 40% figure came from and it directed us to an article about a visit MEPs Ann Widdecombe and Christina Jordan made in June to Newlyn, a fishing town in Cornwall. The article said: “A pressing concern from the quayside is a new directive from the EU to do with net mesh sizes, intended to protect the cod stock but will in fact stop our fishermen catching squid too and some claimed it could lose up to 40% of their income from just this one ruling.” No further background is given about the claim and we can’t find evidence of it anywhere else. The news outlet confirmed to us that a fisherman told them the figure during Ann Widdecombe’s visit, but they were unable to provide any further details. The mesh is the space between four pieces of crossing twine in a fisherman’s net. The mesh size is the “maximum possible opening between two opposite knots” when the mesh is stretched out. The minimum mesh size is regulated—the larger the mesh the easier it is for small fish to escape nets undamaged. Of course, this size depends on what species fishermen are trying to catch. A 2014 briefing from the European Parliament’s own research service called the rules on mesh sizes and fishing equipment “a complex set of EU regulations”. EU regulation has recently changed in this area, and the legislation was adopted by the European Commission at the end of 2018. The regulation was changed using something called a ‘delegated act’. This is where the Commission can adopt new laws without the vote of the European Parliament or Council. The Commission’s power to adopt delegated acts are subject to limits. The European Parliament and Council have to authorise the Commission to adopt delegated acts in the first place, and delegated acts cannot change essential elements of the law. The European Parliament and Council had two months to object to the delegated act on fishing regulations, but this didn’t happen so it is now law. It’s also now in UK law. The UK was one of the EU member states that developed and submitted recommendations on the new act to the Commission. The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) which is the England and Wales marine activities regulator, told us that the changes to mesh sizes came into force for the Celtic Sea on 1 July 2019. It added that the changes for the Celtic Sea in particular were “designed to reduce unwanted catches of cod and haddock primarily”. The MMO added that it was “aware of the implications of these new measures for small scale fisheries such as those targeting squid seasonally and are working with the fishing industry and [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] to find solutions, whilst still ensuring the measures achieve their objectives”. The MMO also wrote about the new rules on its website. It said part of the change is that “larger regional baseline mesh sizes will be introduced” but that “smaller mesh sizes for certain fisheries are allowed”. These are minimum sizes so fishermen could use larger mesh if they want to.

That change to mesh sizes has reduced fishermen’s income by 40%.
","Ann Widdecombe, a Brexit Party MEP, made the following claim during her maiden speech in the European Parliament. “The powers that be have decided to actually increase the size of fishermen’s meshes thereby reducing their income by 40%.” Ann Widdecombe, 4 July 2019 The EU Commission has changed some fishing regulations, which came into force on 1 July 2019, which does include introducing a minimum size of fishing mesh in certain areas. The claim that this will reduce fishermen’s incomes by 40% is based on a quote from an unknown source on a Cornish local news website. We asked the Brexit Party where the 40% figure came from and it directed us to an article about a visit MEPs Ann Widdecombe and Christina Jordan made in June to Newlyn, a fishing town in Cornwall. The article said: “A pressing concern from the quayside is a new directive from the EU to do with net mesh sizes, intended to protect the cod stock but will in fact stop our fishermen catching squid too and some claimed it could lose up to 40% of their income from just this one ruling.” No further background is given about the claim and we can’t find evidence of it anywhere else. The news outlet confirmed to us that a fisherman told them the figure during Ann Widdecombe’s visit, but they were unable to provide any further details. The mesh is the space between four pieces of crossing twine in a fisherman’s net. The mesh size is the “maximum possible opening between two opposite knots” when the mesh is stretched out. The minimum mesh size is regulated—the larger the mesh the easier it is for small fish to escape nets undamaged. Of course, this size depends on what species fishermen are trying to catch. A 2014 briefing from the European Parliament’s own research service called the rules on mesh sizes and fishing equipment “a complex set of EU regulations”. EU regulation has recently changed in this area, and the legislation was adopted by the European Commission at the end of 2018. The regulation was changed using something called a ‘delegated act’. This is where the Commission can adopt new laws without the vote of the European Parliament or Council. The Commission’s power to adopt delegated acts are subject to limits. The European Parliament and Council have to authorise the Commission to adopt delegated acts in the first place, and delegated acts cannot change essential elements of the law. The European Parliament and Council had two months to object to the delegated act on fishing regulations, but this didn’t happen so it is now law. It’s also now in UK law. The UK was one of the EU member states that developed and submitted recommendations on the new act to the Commission. The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) which is the England and Wales marine activities regulator, told us that the changes to mesh sizes came into force for the Celtic Sea on 1 July 2019. It added that the changes for the Celtic Sea in particular were “designed to reduce unwanted catches of cod and haddock primarily”. The MMO added that it was “aware of the implications of these new measures for small scale fisheries such as those targeting squid seasonally and are working with the fishing industry and [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] to find solutions, whilst still ensuring the measures achieve their objectives”. The MMO also wrote about the new rules on its website. It said part of the change is that “larger regional baseline mesh sizes will be introduced” but that “smaller mesh sizes for certain fisheries are allowed”. These are minimum sizes so fishermen could use larger mesh if they want to. The MMO says that most minimum sizes of fish and areas where fishing is restricted remain the same.","
 
That is based on an unsourced quote reported by a Cornish news website. We don’t know how or if income has been affected yet as the regulation only changed on 1 July 2019.

71,fullfact,"The government spends around £50 billion a year to support people with disabilities and health conditions.
","“The government spends around £50 billion a year to support people with disabilities and health conditions.” Department for Work and Pensions press release, 23 February 2017 The government spends around £50 billion a year on benefits that go to disabled people and people with health conditions, as well as their carers. That’s not the same as what is spent on disability benefits. The government’s calculation is including benefits these people receive that aren’t directly related to their health condition, like housing benefit and income support. This is a claim about total spending, it doesn’t tell us very much about how individuals in receipt of these benefits are affected or will be in the future, or how eligibility for benefit payments has changed in recent years. It is possible to find out how many people receive each type of benefit and how much of it they receive, but as people can receive more than one benefit this won’t reflect the actual experiences of many. The government is forecast to spend £51bn on this in in 2017/18. That’s forecast to go up overall in real terms until 2021/22. This includes benefits which are paid wholly to disabled people and people with health conditions such as industrial injuries benefits, personal independence payment (PIP) and employment and support allowance (ESA). Others are paid wholly to carers such as carers allowance. Some of the money included in the government’s calculation comes from the portion of spending on certain benefits which goes to disabled people and people with health conditions or their carers (although the benefits are not exclusively for them). This includes a portion of housing benefit and income support. Government spending on benefits for people with disabilities, health conditions and their carers makes up about 2.5% of GDP and 6.4% of total government spending and is forecast to be around that until 2021/22. It’s also possible to calculate how much the government spends just on the benefits which go wholly to disabled people and people with health conditions. The government spent £39 billion on disability, incapacity and industrial injury benefits in 2017/18. That’s 76% of the total £51 billion spent. This is also forecast to continue rising until 2021/22. Spending on the main disability benefits (DLA, PIP, and attendance allowance) is also forecast to increase in real terms from £23 billion in 2015/16 to £25 billion in 2021/22. The claim originally dates back to 2012. Then it referred not just to benefit spending but other support, such as adult social care, free travel and home adaptations, as well.","The government spends around £50 billion on benefits which go to disabled people and people with health conditions and their carers. This includes payments that aren’t directly to do with people’s health condition such as housing benefit and income support. This figure doesn’t tell us about how individual people’s entitlements have changed due to recent changes to the benefits system.

276,fullfact,"Illegal immigrants or refugees living in Britain get a total yearly benefit of £29,900.
","An image claiming that ‘illegal immigrants’ and refugees can claim a much larger yearly benefit than British pensioners has been widely distributed online, and several of our readers have asked us to factcheck it. It’s very similar to something that went viral six years ago that we factchecked at the time, albeit with slightly different figures. British pensioners who have worked for 45 years are likely to get a minimum payout of £6,500 a year, so more than the number in the picture. Those subject to immigration control aren’t eligible for most benefits, and although refugees can claim the same benefits as UK nationals, the figure quoted is unrealistically high. In 2015, the House of Commons Library wrote about a similar claim circulated via email that quoted the same figures with slightly different accompanying text. The library said “The figures quoted bear no relation whatsoever to the situation in the United Kingdom”.   The image mentions a “total yearly benefit” for pensioners, which looks like it is referring to their pension.  Pensioners can also be eligible for other benefits, like winter fuel payments, means-tested benefits like pension credit, and a free TV license. If the pensioner in their example is a man born before April 6 1951 or a woman born before April 6 1953, they can claim the basic state pension. A full basic state pension is £125.95 a week, which amounts to around £6,500 per year. This excludes any top ups to the state pension.   The image mentions this pensioner has worked for 45 years, so we can assume they have the 30 qualifying years of national insurance contributions. If the pensioner was born after those dates, they can claim the new state pension, which is £164.25 in full, which per year is around £8,500. People need to have 35 years of national insurance payments to qualify for this amount. This excludes any protected payments, which is extra money older workers entitled to the new state pension may have amassed under the old system. Regardless of when they were born, assuming this pensioner has worked for 45 years, they have 45 years of national insurance contributions and are likely to be eligible for more than the £6,000 a year claimed. In response to a 2016 petition asking the government to ‘Stop all benefits to illegal immigrants completely’, the government said: “Illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are not entitled to, and do not get, benefits from the UK’s welfare system”. In its debunking paper for the email, the House of Commons Library defines illegal immigrants as those who entered the UK unlawfully or stayed for longer than they were allowed without applying to stay longer. Those in the UK without legal status are likely to be removed if their immigration status is discovered by the authorities. They inherently do not have the right to work in the UK and we don’t have figures for those that do so anyway. As a result of the Welfare Reform Act 2012, only people with the right to work in the UK can collect National Insurance contribution based benefits like jobseeker’s and employment and support allowance, and work related benefits like statutory maternity pay. People subject to immigration control (who require leave to enter or remain in the UK but don’t have it) are also prevented from collecting payments like housing and child benefit, and universal credit. The term refugees refers to asylum seekers whose applications for asylum have been successful. According to a House of Commons research briefing, refugees “are able to claim social security benefits and tax credits on the same basis as UK nationals”. That means they would theoretically be eligible for the same kinds of pensions as the British pensioners described above would, although aren’t as likely to have built up the required national insurance contributions if they arrived in adulthood. The £29,900 figure quoted in the image is unusually high—the benefits cap means the maximum payment of certain types of benefits to a couple or single person with children in London is £23,000 per household. Refugees in this image may refer to asylum seekers who are still awaiting a decision on their asylum application to remain here. To be eligible for asylum, someone must be unable to live safely in their country out of fear of persecution because of characteristics like race, religion or political opinions that put them at risk there. Asylum seekers who are waiting for a decision are not allowed to claim mainstream non-contributory social security benefits, and are not usually allowed to work either. But they may be eligible for asylum support from the Home Office, which parliament described as “less generous than social security benefits” in its debunking briefing. This support can consist of somewhere to live (which they cannot choose and is unlikely to be in London or the South East), plus £37.75 per person in the household a week. They can also get £3-5 per week per pregnant mother, baby and child under three, and may qualify for a one off maternity payment of £300.  The House of Commons Library said the claim they checked in 2015, which was spread by email, may have originated from a similar message circulated in Australia. The government there subsequently debunked it, but there have also been similar versions in Canada and India with some details changed.","Illegal immigrants cannot collect benefits, and refugees can on the same basis as UK nationals once their request for asylum is granted—but this figure is unusually high.

As a result of the Welfare Reform Act 2012, only people with the right to work in the UK can collect National Insurance contribution based benefits like jobseeker’s and employment and support allowance, and work related benefits like statutory maternity pay. People subject to immigration control (who require leave to enter or remain in the UK but don’t have it) are also prevented from collecting payments like housing and child benefit, and universal credit. The term refugees refers to asylum seekers whose applications for asylum have been successful. According to a House of Commons research briefing, refugees “are able to claim social security benefits and tax credits on the same basis as UK nationals”. That means they would theoretically be eligible for the same kinds of pensions as the British pensioners described above would, although aren’t as likely to have built up the required national insurance contributions if they arrived in adulthood. The £29,900 figure quoted in the image is unusually high—the benefits cap means the maximum payment of certain types of benefits to a couple or single person with children in London is £23,000 per household. Refugees in this image may refer to asylum seekers who are still awaiting a decision on their asylum application to remain here. To be eligible for asylum, someone must be unable to live safely in their country out of fear of persecution because of characteristics like race, religion or political opinions that put them at risk there. Asylum seekers who are waiting for a decision are not allowed to claim mainstream non-contributory social security benefits, and are not usually allowed to work either. But they may be eligible for asylum support from the Home Office, which parliament described as “less generous than social security benefits” in its debunking briefing. This support can consist of somewhere to live (which they cannot choose and is unlikely to be in London or the South East), plus £37.75 per person in the household a week. They can also get £3-5 per week per pregnant mother, baby and child under three, and may qualify for a one off maternity payment of £300.  The House of Commons Library said the claim they checked in 2015, which was spread by email, may have originated from a similar message circulated in Australia. The government there subsequently debunked it, but there have also been similar versions in Canada and India with some details changed.","
 
A British pensioner with 45 years’ worth of national insurance contributions is likely to earn at least £500 a year more than this, and be eligible for more benefits on top.

","“The figures show that the performance in getting payments to people on time has improved substantially, and more people are getting advanced payments.” Theresa May, 18 October 2017 Universal Credit is attempting to simplify lots of different social security benefits into one. It’s a complicated project that will affect 7 million people and there have been many difficulties. It is now five years behind schedule. More people are receiving their first Universal Credit payment on time, as we discussed last week. The share of people who were paid an advance on their first full service Universal Credit payment has also increased. It was 30% in May 2016 and 52% in July 2017, so over half of new claimants were paid an advance. If someone can’t wait six weeks for their first payment they can apply for an advance, which they’ll pay back out of future Universal Credit payments. Advance payments range from less than £50 to over £600. They are most often around £100 to £200. They’re capped at 50% of the expected monthly Universal Credit payment. The amount also has to be repayable within six months for new claims and twelve months for people transferring from other benefits. This fact check is part of a roundup of Prime Minister's Questions. Read the roundup.","Correct. Advances made on the first payment of new Universal Credit claims increased from 30% of claims in May 2016 to 52% in July 2017.

96,fullfact,"People with a terminal illness are being declared fit to work and told to apply for jobs.
","We were asked by readers to factcheck this image, which has been widely shared online. There have been cases, reported in the media and by charities, where people with terminal illnesses have been asked to meet work coaches, attend work-focussed interviews, or told their benefits would be withdrawn as they were deemed fit to work. We don’t know of any research into how widespread this is. The government’s definition of terminal illness in this case is a progressive disease likely to cause death in six months or less. Though it does say it realises that predicting “life expectancy isn’t an exact science”. When applying for some benefits, such as Universal Credit and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), there are ‘special rules’ which should apply to people with a terminal illness. They are not meant to have face to face assessments to claim certain benefits, and their applications are fast tracked so they can get their payments sooner. The government says that: “Special rules for people who are terminally ill provide a guaranteed entitlement to benefit… We are committed to meeting the needs of terminally ill claimants, therefore these rules are kept under review on an ongoing basis.” It also said it’s aware that some people have encountered “issues with the service” for terminally ill people trying to claim universal benefit and of “concerns raised about the process”. ESA is a benefit for people with disabilities or illnesses which mean they are unable to work or can only work a limited number of hours. Income-related ESA is also one of the benefits being replaced by Universal Credit. Most people who apply for ESA or Universal Credit undergo a work capability assessment to decide whether they’re eligible. For ESA, if they are eligible, they will be put in one of two groups—a work-related activity group which involves interviews with an advisor and working to improve job prospects, or a support group with no interviews. Terminally ill people should be assigned to the support group when they apply, in this group they can receive a higher rate of benefit. People with a terminal illness who claim Universal Credit may also be able to receive a higher rate of benefit. In the DWP’s guidelines for work capability assessments, it says that “there is no requirement for terminally ill claimants to participate in any form of work-related activity”. 3% of those assigned to the ESA support group after first making a claim in June 2017 were assigned to the group because of terminal illness. This was around 300 people. If someone is declared fit for work after their ESA work capability assessment and disagrees with the decision, they can ask for a mandatory reconsideration of their case. If the decision is not revised, they can appeal again at an independent tribunal. You can read more about fit for work appeals in our factcheck here. Some people think the definition of a terminal illness should be changed. The charity Macmillan Cancer Support asked the government to change its definition from six to 12 months over a decade ago. The terminal illness charity, Marie Curie, says the definition is not fair on those who require financial support but aren’t likely to die within six months. New laws in Scotland will replace the six month definition. For a number of benefits that are to be devolved to Scotland a terminal illness will now be defined as an illness that a clinician decides “can reasonably be expected to cause the individual’s death”. These devolved benefits don’t include Universal Credit or ESA though.","Examples of this happening have been reported by the media and charities, but it’s not supposed to. We don’t know how widespread this is.

72,fullfact,"Claiming to be living alone is one of the most common types of benefit fraud.
","“Claiming to be living alone is one of the most common types of benefit fraud” Department for Work and Pensions, 13 February 2018 Just in time for Valentine’s Day, the Department for Work and Pensions reminded loved-up couples receiving benefits to declare their living arrangements. It said that people claiming to be living alone, when they weren’t, was one of the most common types of benefit fraud. Looking at the cost of overpayments where benefit fraud has happened, about 9% was estimated to be down to claimants saying they were single and not informing DWP they actually lived with someone else and had a “joint household” in 2016/17. So this was probably the fourth most common type of benefit fraud that year, where the reason was known. The figure includes the cost of fraud overpayments for Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Pension Credit, Housing Benefit, Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment. These account for around a third of all benefit spending and a sample of cases are continuously reviewed for fraud and other types of overpayment or underpayment to claimants. From this sample of benefits an overall estimate is then produced, so there is a grey area around the numbers meaning we can’t be sure exactly what the rank order is. Most other benefits are only reviewed occasionally or not at all so we don’t know the specific reasons for fraud overpayments in these cases. DWP says that benefit fraud occurs when three things happen: “The basic conditions for receipt of benefit, or the rate of benefit in payment, are not being met; The claimant can reasonably be expected to be aware of the effect on entitlement; [and] Benefit stops or reduces as a result of the review”. Concealing employment by the claimant or the claimant’s partner was the most common type of fraud (estimated to be 35% of spending on fraud overpayments) where the reason was known.  Other fraud types include ‘loss of claimant contact’, which is estimated to account for 23% of fraud overpayments. This is where a claimant being reviewed by the survey does not engage with the process, or withdraws their benefit claim.  An estimated 9% of fraud overpayments relate to the information about a claimant’s savings being hidden or incorrect. Benefit fraud is one type of overpayment—where money is lost because claimants are paid too much.  Fraud accounted for almost two thirds of overpayments in 2016/17 where the reason for the overpayment was known. Other overpayments were due to errors made by the claimant or officials. The value of fraud overpayments was estimated to be 1.2% of all benefit spending that year. The estimates don’t catch every instance of fraud. “This is because fraud is, by its nature, a covert activity and some suspicions of fraud on the sample cases cannot be proven.”","It was probably the fourth most common type of benefit fraud in 2016/17 where the specific reason was known, accounting for an estimated 9% of overpayments relating to fraud.

73,fullfact,"Pensioner poverty has fallen considerably since the 1970s and 80s.
","“[There has been] a tremendous reduction in pensioner poverty in this country. In the 70s and 80s, 40% of pensioners in this country lived in poverty, that was disgraceful. We've got that figure now right down to 14%.” Damian Green, 27 April 2017 “There are still 2 million of them that live in pensioner poverty” Clive Lewis MP, 27 April 2017 Both politicians are talking about the relative measure of poverty and are largely correct, although Damian Green is slightly underestimating the current rate. Relative poverty compares households’ income to the national average. Anyone who falls below 60% of the median income is defined as in poverty. An estimated 1.9 million pensioners were in poverty on this measure in 2015/16, out of a total 12 million across the UK. That’s a rate of 16%, and includes the costs of housing, which is the measure preferred by the government and analysts. That also compares to a rate of 22% for the population as a whole. You could instead look at absolute poverty, which compares people to a fixed standard of living, adjusted for inflation over time. It puts pensioner poverty slightly lower at 1.6 million and 14%, still including housing costs. Again, that’s lower than the equivalent overall poverty rate of 20%. Over the long term, pensioner poverty has fallen. Relative pensioner poverty—the preferred measure for long-term trends—hit 40% at various points in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, according to analysis of official estimates from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Since then, it’s been falling almost constantly year on year. The latest estimate puts it at 16%. Damian Green might have been referring to last year’s estimate of 14% when he spoke on the programme. Back in the 1990s, the absolute and relative poverty rates for pensioners were higher than the average for all households working age households without children; now the opposite is the case, according to the IFS.  Why those huge shifts in the 1980s? Pensioner poverty tends to increase in times of high economic growth, according to past research. That’s because the incomes of people in work can rise a lot faster than prices during these periods, while pensions tended in the past to track prices more closely. That means that, on the relative measure, pensioner poverty can go up simply by virtue of everyone else pulling ahead. Damian Green mentioned on the programme that the ‘triple lock’ on pensions has been a key driver of falls in pensioner poverty. The government has actually said as recently as last year that it can’t draw a direct link between the triple lock and pensioner poverty, but that it expected it had an impact. It’s certainly true that a big part of the general trend is down to pensioner benefits faring better than benefits for working-age people over the last decade, so the triple lock is likely to play a part. The average income from pensioner benefits was down 2.5% in real terms from 2009/10 to 2014/15, compared to a 10.3% fall for working-age families, for example. Pensioners are also increasingly in work, which is often a way out of poverty. 10% of people over the page of 65 are in work, according to the latest figures from the start of 2017. That was about 7% a decade ago and about 5% back in 1997. Update 28 April 2017  We've added an explanation for why we use the relative measure of poverty for the long-term trends. This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","Correct. On the relative measure, pensioner poverty has fallen from peaks of 40% in those decades to about 16% now. Absolute poverty has also fallen long term.

74,fullfact,"Pensioners are getting £1,250 more a year than they did when the Conservatives entered government.  
","“£1,250 more a year for pensioners. That’s a record we can be proud of.” Theresa May , 19 April 2017 The government has increased the cash given to pensioners eligible for the full basic state pension. But once inflation is taken into account, the increase is less than half of what the Prime Minister suggests, and is only for pensioners receiving the full amount of the basic state pension. The Department for Work and Pensions told us that the Prime Minister was referring to changes in the amount paid to pensioners who receive the full basic state pension. The basic state pension is a payment from the government that you receive if you reached state pension age before 6 April 2016 and you paid National Insurance contributions during your working life. In 2017/18, the basic state pension is £122.30 per week. In 2010/11 pensioners eligible for the full basic state pension were paid £97.65 per week. This is £24.65 less per week than in 2017/18. Per year, this is £1,281.80 more in cash. But what about inflation? Simply put, things cost more in 2017 than they did in 2010. What does this mean for changes in the state pension? If that £97.65 state pension in 2010/11 had just risen in line with inflation, it would only be worth £111.55 now. So it’s actually £10.75 more per week, or £558.62 a year, from the government once we account for inflation. To get the highest possible amount from the basic state pension you must have paid National Insurance or received National Insurance Credits for 30 years. This means that not all pensioners eligible for the basic state pension will get the increase mentioned by the Prime Minister. The changes the Prime Minister was referring to don’t cover the new state pension. If you reach state pension age on or after 6 April 2016 you’ll receive this form of pension instead, for which the highest possible payment is £159.55 per week. This amount is higher because the new state pension isn’t topped up with the additional State Pension like the old one is. Instead you receive one payment based solely on your National Insurance contributions. Update 28 April 2017  We've updated our explanation of inflation to make it clearer. This fact check is part of a roundup of Prime Minister's Questions. Read the roundup.","Pensioners who receive the full basic state pension in 2017/18 are getting £1,250 more in cash per year than those receiving it in 2010/11. However, in real terms the increase is only £558.82 extra per year, and only for pensioners receiving the full basic state pension.

75,fullfact,"Roughly 40% of people on welfare are pensioners, and 10% or 20% are taking in-work benefits.

","""People forget actually that maybe 40% of people on welfare are actually old-age pensioners... another 10% or 20% are taking in-work benefits."" Diane Abbott MP, 6 April 2017 We haven’t found figures to back up Ms Abbott’s claim. In fact there don’t seem to be any readily-available estimates of the age of people claiming welfare benefits overall. It’s possible to get this for individual benefits, but this doesn’t answer the claim. We’ve asked Ms Abbott’s office for the source. The most claimed welfare payments are claimed entirely or predominantly by pensioners—provided you count pensions as welfare. Just under 16 million people got a Christmas Bonus last year (£10 paid to people who get certain welfare payments), 13 million got the State Pension and 12 million got a Winter Fuel Payment.  These figures just relate to Great Britain as the Northern Ireland Executive is responsible for welfare payments there. There’s a huge overlap here: most people who claim the State Pension get the Christmas Bonus and Winter Fuel Payment automatically.  As a rough estimate we could be looking at around 13 million pensioners who claim welfare payments in Great Britain. So for Ms Abbott to be right, we’d need to find something like 20 million people of working age or children receiving other payments. The biggest bulk of that would have to be the 7.4 million families claiming Child Benefit for nearly 13 million children, for example. You’d also have to consider big caseloads like tax credits and housing benefit. Again, we can’t produce an estimate here because some people will claim several of these at once. Finally, it’s possible to get a clearer picture by just looking at what’s spent on welfare rather than who’s claiming it. An estimated 56% of all welfare spending in Great Britain goes to pensioners. That’s been rising since 2009 when it was 52%, as government spending policies since then have largely protected pensioners. Correction 10 April 2017  We have corrected a typo.  This fact check is part of a roundup of BBC Question Time. Read the roundup.","We haven’t found figures to back this up.

The government committed over £1 billion to reduce the impact of changes and limit them to 18 months.
","“This injustice [changes to the state pension retirement age] has short changed 2.6 million WASPI women and brings shame to this government.”  Chris Elmore MP, 1 February 2017 “We did commit over £1 billion to lessen the impact on those worst affected so no-one will see their pension age change by more than 18 months. But there is a wider point here, we do have to be realistic in looking at pension ages about the fact that people are living longer...” Theresa May, 1 February 2017 The move to make the state pension age equal for men and women, and increase it to 66 by 2020, means women born in the 1950s onwards are retiring later than they expected.  A law in 2011 brought forward the year when the state pension would increase to 66, from 2026 to 2020. Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) are a group campaigning for a ‘bridging’ pension for women born in the 1950s affected by the changes and the 2011 timetable. 2.6 million women are affected by the 2011 changes. The government did slow down its proposed timetable so no-one would face new changes of more than 18 months, reducing proposed savings by £1.1 billion. The state pension age was originally set at 65 years old for men, and 60 years for women. In 1995 a new law increased women’s state pension age from 60 to 65 between 2010 and 2020. This meant that women born in the 1950s (and after) would reach retirement age later than they had planned. Research has shown many women weren’t aware they were affected.  A 2007 law then added an increase to the equal state pension age from 66 to 68, to be brought in between 2024 and 2046.  In 2011 the timetable was sped up, so state pension ages would be equal at 65 by 2018, and rise to 66 for everyone by 2020. The new changes affect around 5 million people born between 1953 and 1960 in Great Britain, 2.6 million women and 2.3 million men. Women born between 1950 and 1953 were affected by the 1995 law and reached retirement age by March last year. Together the changes delay women’s state pension age between three and six years compared to retiring at 60. Further changes made in 2014 have now brought forward when the equal pension age will increase to 67, from 2034-2036 to 2026-2028. The first version of the 2011 law would have delayed some women's pension by two more years. The government shortened that to a maximum of 18 months, reducing the savings from the changes by £1.1 billion. Some people, such as the WASPI campaigners, don’t think that went far enough.  The UK does have an aging population, and despite these changes the number of working-age people per pensioner is expected to fall. You can check your state pension age online.

Correct. The government limited the increase in the state pension age from the new 2011 timetable so that no-one would face an increase of more than 18 months. That reduced the savings it would otherwise have made by £1.1 billion. Overall, changes since 1995 mean some women will retire three to six years later planned.

Two thirds of people with mental health conditions claiming PIP receive the higher daily living allowance compared to less than a quarter under DLA. 
","“If you look at the figures two thirds of people with mental health conditions who are in receipt of, who are claiming Personal Independence Payments and are in receipt of that, two thirds of them actually get awarded the higher daily living rate allowance. That two thirds compares to less than a quarter under the previous DLA arrangements.” Theresa May, 1 March 2017 “one of the effects of the transition from DLA to PIP is that more people are now eligible for support—particularly those, as it happens, with mental health problems” Damian Green, 12 July 2017 Fewer people are successfully claiming the disability benefit PIP than were claiming its predecessor DLA. People claiming disability benefits mainly because of mental health conditions are now more likely to be receiving the higher rate. But that doesn’t mean that those claiming these benefits are all better off. PIP was intended to apply to 20% fewer people than DLA when it was introduced. More people have been awarded PIP than expected, but the Office of Budget Responsibility still predicts it has saved 5% in government spending. Comparisons between the older and newer benefits are tricky because PIP is still being rolled out and the eligibility criteria have changed. The main non-means tested disability benefit is in the process of changing from Disability Living Allowance (DLA) to Personal Independence Payment (PIP). Both benefits have two main parts: one to help with daily living and one to help with mobility. The criteria for claiming each benefit is different, but people can be eligible for either or both parts, and can get different levels of payment depending on their assessed level of need. Theresa May is talking about the daily living component of PIP and comparing this to the equivalent part of DLA. The highest payment available for help with daily living is £82.30 for both DLA and PIP. The categories of ‘main disabling condition’ are different between the two benefits, so it can be difficult to directly compare them. For example, the DLA data includes a category for ‘psychoneurosis’, while PIP data separates out anxiety disorders, mood disorders and mixed anxiety and depressive disorders. The data tells us only about the ‘main’ reason someone has for claiming the benefit. Some people have multiple physical and mental conditions but only one is recorded. The criteria for claiming the benefit has also changed. We can say that 66% of those claiming PIP mainly for mental health conditions received the higher payment in the most recent data from April 2017. Only 22% of DLA claimants for mental health conditions in May 2013 (when PIP was introduced) received this higher payment. Fewer people are claiming PIP than DLA as the new benefit is still being rolled out. The share of people receiving the higher rate may change as more people move from DLA to PIP. 741,000 people with a mental health condition were claiming DLA in May 2013, and just under two thirds of that number–476,000–were claiming PIP for a mental health condition in April 2017. However people who have been moved from DLA to PIP are more likely to be awarded the higher rate than new claimants. We compared working age people claiming DLA to those claiming PIP as that is the condition for receiving the newer benefit. The government originally assumed introducing a new assessment would reduce the number of people claiming DLA by 20%. PIP has been introduced more slowly than planned, and the number of people being awarded the higher rates of the benefit has been higher than predicted. Spending on PIP will be 5% lower by 2017/18 compared to DLA continuing, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility. On average 73% of all people moving from DLA and 41% of new people claiming were awarded PIP from April 2016-2017. This suggests that fewer people are eligible for PIP. We have older detailed statistics on how people moving from DLA to PIP have been assessed, but they combine the daily living and mobility payments. What we can say is that 193,000 people with mental health conditions were re-assessed between October 2013 and October 2016. 39% were awarded more money, 14% given the same amount, 22% were awarded less money and 25% no longer received the benefit. So while more people on the PIP payments may be receiving the higher living allowance, this doesn’t necessarily mean claimants with mental health conditions are receiving more money in total under the new form of payment. Moving from DLA to PIP removed the lowest care bracket (£21.80). The Government says that PIP “is designed to focus more support on those who are likely to have a higher level of need, and higher costs associated with their disability”. 24% of all people receiving the lower rate for care under DLA did not qualify for PIP at the assessment stage. 4% were awarded the mobility part of the benefit but not the daily living part. To receive the higher rate for care under DLA a person had to show they needed: and They had to have needed help for at least three months and expect to need it for another six months. To receive the ‘enhanced daily living allowance’ under the new benefit, PIP, a person has to score 12 points from a list of ten areas of daily activities. For example, someone with a mental health condition might need: or (i) overwhelming psychological distress to the claimant; or (ii) the claimant to exhibit behaviour which would result in a substantial risk of harm to the claimant or another person. (8 points) They must have had these difficulties for three months and expect them to last for at least nine months. Update 1 August 2017  We've updated this article to cover a newer claim by Damian Green and to clarify that the available data only tells us about the main reason why people are claiming the benefits. Some people have multiple physical and mental conditions but only one is recorded.","

207,fullfact,"A court ruled that more people are entitled to the PIP benefit because they were suffering from “overwhelming psychological distress”.
","Court decisions last year mean that more people would have got the disability benefit PIP, or a higher amount of it. An argument over the reasons behind these decisions dominated Prime Minister’s Questions today: “The court ruled that the payment should be made because the people who are going to benefit from it were suffering overwhelming psychological distress.” Jeremy Corbyn, 1 March 2017 “What the court said is that the regulations were unclear.” Theresa May, 1 March 2017 The court in question is the Upper Tribunal. It made two decisions in November 2016, the effect of which the government is now reversing with new PIP regulations. That’s expected to affect people with mental health conditions in particular. In making the first decision, Upper Tribunal Judge Mesher said that it “illustrates once again the gaps left in the drafting of [the original PIP regulations], requiring a large expenditure of effort to render its provisions coherent”. And in the second, three judges pointed to “a difference of opinion within the Upper Tribunal” on what the regulations mean. So Ms May is correct in that sense. The regulations (introduced by the Coalition government) are ambiguous enough that even judges struggle to apply them consistently to real-life cases. The second of these decisions was about “overwhelming psychological distress”, and how this related to someone’s ability to “follow the route” of a familiar or unfamiliar journey. This isn’t a phrase that the judges introduced. It’s from the original PIP regulations. For example, people are awarded four points towards their entitlement to PIP if they need “prompting to be able to undertake any journey to avoid overwhelming psychological distress”. There are also scores of 10 for those who can’t “follow the route of an unfamiliar journey” without assistance, and 12 for those who can’t “follow the route of a familiar journey” without assistance. You need at least 8 points to get this part of PIP at the standard rate, and 12 for the enhanced rate. What the Upper Tribunal had to decide was whether the regulations allowed for someone being unable to “follow the route” of a journey because of overwhelming psychological distress.  The government had argued that such distress couldn’t be considered for the purposes of these particular scores. It said they were focused on “sensory or cognitive impairment”.  The Upper Tribunal rejected this argument, saying that the government had been correct to concede the point in a prior case. It reasoned that someone might be overtaken by psychological distress while trying to follow a route, if he or she didn’t have assistance.  That means someone might be entitled to four, 10 or 12 points because of psychological distress—which the tribunal thought was fine: “there is no reason why there should not be an overlap”.  The judgment was a highly technical analysis of the language and logic behind these regulations.  This fact check is part of a roundup of Prime Minister's Questions. Read the roundup.","The Upper Tribunal’s decision was based on the interpretation and application of the language of the complicated PIP regulations, which include the phrase “overwhelming psychological distress”. It decided that - in relation to the case assessed - the individual’s “overwhelming psychological distress” made them satisfy additional parts of the criteria for assessing PIP eligibility.

In response to a letter from the shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood MP, the chair of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove, wrote to confirm that “the 200,000 figure represents the Department for Work and Pensions’ estimate of the predicted impact on employment once Universal Credit is fully rolled out rather than the effect so far.” The figure originally appeared in a document released by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in June 2018, which argued the business case for the introduction of Universal Credit.  The National Audit Office expressed “significant doubt about the main benefits” that the DWP expected. It also said that the DWP would not be able to measure the effect of Universal Credit, because it could not filter out other effects on employment from the wider economy.","Incorrect. This was the government’s estimate of what Universal Credit would do by 2024/5. It may not be reliable, and can never be measured properly.

Funding for pensions has increased significantly in recent years.
","“State expenditure is at a record high, reaching a colossal £841 billion this financial year… “funding for vital areas such as the NHS, schools and pensions has increased significantly in recent years.” Daily Express, 9 January 2020 Columnist Leo McKinstry has argued in the Daily Express that the government should look at reducing waste and inefficiency in government spending, noting that state expenditure has reached a record high, with funding for schools, the NHS and pensions also increasing in recent years. It’s correct that public spending is £841 billion. This is the amount the government expects to spend in the 2019/20 financial year. It’s also correct to say this is a record high, both in cash terms and real terms (once you adjust for inflation). The problem is that these figures aren’t very useful in telling whether state spending is relatively high or low, historically speaking, as the country’s economy and population has changed a lot over the years. That’s why the better measure to use when looking at public spending over time is public spending as a percentage of the size of the economy as a whole. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that public spending in 2019/20 will amount to 40% of the total UK economy. That’s not a record high. The state has been relatively bigger than it is now during various points in the past hundred years, notably during the Second World War when the UK government planned the economy as part of the war effort.  Mr McKinstry also writes that funding for the NHS, schools and pensions has increased significantly in recent years. School spending in England in 2018/19 totalled around £50 billion. However the most meaningful way to look at school spending is not the total spend but the spend per pupil which is now 8% lower than it was in 2009/10. Government commitments to increase education spending over the next few years will take spending per pupil back up to that 2009/10 level by 2022/23. Health spending in England has increased in recent years, though it has increased for almost the entire history of the NHS. This is partly because demand for healthcare has continued to grow as the population grows and ages. In 2018, then-Prime Minister Theresa May announced a funding increase for the NHS in England, averaging 3.4% per year until 2023/24. This was welcomed by health think tanks the Nuffield Trust, Health Foundation and King’s Fund, and others like the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), who have said that the money will allow the NHS to “help stem further decline in the health service”. But they said that increases of at least 4% a year on average are needed in order to meet the NHS’s needs and see any improvement in its services. On pensions the picture is complex. The state pension has increased in recent years due to the decision in 2010 by the coalition government to bring in the “triple lock”, meaning the state pension increases each year by earnings, prices or 2.5%—whichever is highest. The amount of money spent on pensioner benefits in total has increased by around £8 billion since 2010, but since 2014 has remained fairly stable in real terms at around £128 billion per year.   Deputy Director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies Carl Emmerson told us: “The triple lock has, since 2010, pushed up pensioner benefit spending substantially in real terms. But in the other direction the increases in the state pension age for women and, more recently, men will have cut it.” In other words, the government has increased the average amount a pensioner will receive, but reduced the number of pensioners by increasing the pension age.","
 
The state pension has increased in recent years, but because the pension age has increased, fewer people are now eligible for the pension. So while state spending on pensioner benefits has risen since 2010 it has remained stable in the last few years.

224,fullfact,"Millions of women have been plunged into poverty because of changes to the pension age made in 2011.
","“[On changes to the state pension age made in 2011] It is completely unacceptable and millions of women have been plunged into poverty…” Angela Rayner, 24 November 2019 On the Andrew Marr Show, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner was promoting Labour’s plan to compensate the WASPI women.  WASPI stands for women against state pension inequality. Their campaign relates to changes to the women’s pension age that were introduced in 1995 and 2011. As a result, around five million people born between 1953 and 1960 in Great Britain (both men and women) now have to wait longer before they reach state pension age, with women born between December 1953 and October 1954 having the longest wait (18 months).  Ms Rayner’s comments specifically referred to the law passed in 2011 which brought forward a rise in the state pension age to 66 from 2026 to 2020. This meant that the already planned increase in women’s state pension age from 60 to 65 sped up. Anyone born between 6 April 1953 and 5 April 1960 will have their state pension age brought forward by the law. Those born after 5 February 1955 have yet to be affected directly by the change. Ms Rayner said: “It is completely unacceptable and millions of women have been plunged into poverty.” It seems likely that the policy has increased poverty, but not by anywhere near “millions” (whatever standard definition of poverty you choose to take). For starters, there aren’t millions of women aged 60-64 who are in poverty (the age group that includes most of those affected who have not yet retired). The best estimates we’ve seen suggest around 300,000 to 350,000 women in this age group are in relative low income (between 2015 and 2018). This is a commonly-used measure of poverty in the UK. So there’s no evidence that millions of women have been plunged into poverty because of the 2011 Act. It’s also unlikely that millions will be plunged into poverty once the law has been fully implemented. By 2026, when the shift in the pension age will be completed, 2.6 million women will have been affected. But it’s highly unlikely all of these women will be at some point in poverty due to the Act’s effects. The Institute for Fiscal Studies analysed data between 2010 and 2014, finding that among women aged 60 to 62 affected by an earlier increase in the State Pension, the poverty rate increased by over six percentage points as a result of the changes. Although the income of these women decreased due to not receiving the state pension, they were more likely to be in work which reduced this effect. This suggests only a very small proportion of the 2.6 million women affected are likely to be in poverty as a result of the change.","This is an exaggeration. We don’t know the exact number but it is likely substantially lower.

","“Their [the Conservatives] ambition: a state pension age of 75”. John McDonnell, 7 November 2019 In a speech today, Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said that the Conservatives’ ambition is a state pension age of 75. This is not current Conservative party policy, and we first checked a version of this claim back in August. A recommendation that the State Pension Age be increased to 75 by 2035 was made by the Centre for Social Justice, in a report published in August. The Centre for Social justice is the think tank that first proposed Universal Credit, and it is chaired by former Conservative work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith. But this recommendation has not been adopted by the Conservative party. In August we spoke to the Department for Work and Pensions, which told us that it wasn’t government policy to do this. At the time of writing the Conservatives had not announced such a policy either. State pension age in the UK is currently a little over 65 for both men and women. By October 2020 it will have risen to 66, from 66 to 67 between the years 2026 and 2028, and then from 67 to 68 between 2044 and 2046.","This was recommended in a report by the Centre for Social Justice think tank.

After nine years of a Conservative government, local government funding is down 50%.
","“Everyone needs reminding that after 9 years of a Tory Government: “Child poverty + 50% “Food-bank use + 1,000% “Homelessness + 170% “NHS waiting list + 70% “Police numbers - 20% “Crime + 30% “Local gov funding - 50% “Public sector pay - 15%” Freddie Bailey (Labour councillor), 5 October 2019 A viral tweet by a Labour councillor has been shared over 13,000 times. It makes a number of claims about what has happened after “9 years of a Tory Government”. Of the eight claims, three are flatly wrong—the ones about child poverty, crime, and public sector pay. The other five claims are accurate, although some could benefit from additional context. This article takes a look at each of the claims in turn, looking at the records of the coalition government from 2010-2015 and the Conservatives alone since then. Some of the figures seem to refer to the whole of the UK, while others focus on England and Wales, we’ve indicated where that is the case. “Child poverty + 50%” There are a number of ways to measure child poverty, but none of them show an increase of close to 50% since 2010. The Social Metrics Commission, an independent group of experts on poverty, estimates that the number of UK children in poverty in 2017/18 is down by 2%, compared to 2009/10. The percentage of children in poverty is also down by two percentage points. In addition, two standard measures of poverty used by government are the number of children living in a household in relative or absolute poverty (you can read more about how those measures are calculated here). The number of children living in relative poverty in the UK in 2017/18 is up 5%, compared to 2009/10 (the last year before the Coalition government came into office). The percentage of children in relative poverty is the same now as it was in 2009/10. The number of children living in absolute poverty is down 3%, and the percentage of children is down two percentage points. These estimates all account for the housing costs of a household. But separate figures measure poverty before you factor that in. If you look at relative poverty, before housing costs, then the increase in child poverty between 2010/11 (rather than 2009/10) and 2017/18 is 30%. That’s the biggest increase we can see in the data in relation to this claim. We did find a May 2018 article from the Independent stating: “Number of children growing up in poverty… up almost 50 per cent since 2010.” This is inaccurate as the research it is reporting on refers to children in working households growing up in poverty—not all children in poverty. “Food-bank use + 1,000%” In 2018/19, the Trussell Trust—a UK-wide network of food banks—gave out almost 1.6 million three-day emergency food supplies to people in crisis. In 2009/10 it gave out almost 41,000 three-day packages, and in 2010/11 it gave out 61,000 supplies. Looking at either year, the increase is well over 1,000% to 2018/19. This is the number of individual three-day packages given out, not the number of people using Trussell Trust food banks altogether. It’s difficult to know exactly how much this reflects increased need for emergency food supplies, and we’ve looked at this debate in more detail before. It’s also important to note that the Trussell Trust is not the only food bank network in the UK, so this isn’t a complete picture of food bank use.  “Homelessness + 170%” This most likely refers to the number of people who are sleeping rough in England (which isn’t the same as overall homelessness). Rough sleeping increased by 165% from 2010 to 2018 (we don’t have data for earlier than that). However, we shouldn’t treat these statistics as definitive. The figures are estimated by councils in autumn each year, and largely involve counting the number of people sleeping rough on the streets on a single night. These estimates are known to undercount total rough sleeping and separate estimates for London, which are taken over the course of the year, show a higher number of rough sleepers than the government data. Additionally, rough sleepers are a minority of all people who are officially defined as homeless in the UK. In many cases “homeless” refers to households that are threatened with the loss of, or unable to continue with, their current accommodation. Around 57,000 households in England were defined as homeless and owed a legal duty to be rehoused in 2017/18—an increase of 41% compared to 2009/10. “NHS waiting list + 70%” In May 2019 there were almost 4.4 million referrals for treatment on the NHS in England, where the treatment had not yet begun. These “incomplete” treatments are often referred to as the “waiting list”, and it saw an increase of 70% compared to May 2010. In the most recent data (comparing July 2010 to July 2019) the increase is 65%.  “Police numbers - 20%” There were around 202,000 members of the police workforce in England and Wales in March 2019. That’s a decrease of 17% compared to March 2010. Looking solely at police officers, the number fell by 14% over the same period—to just over 123,000 in March 2019. This excludes some officers and staff like the British Transport Police, special constables, and those on secondments to central services. “Crime + 30%” Crime is very difficult to measure accurately, but the weight of evidence suggests that overall crime has fallen since 2010—and certainly not risen by 30%. One measure—the total amount of crime recorded by the police in England and Wales—shows a 37% increase in crime between March 2010 and March 2019. But this is not a reliable way of measuring change over time. The figures can’t pick up crime that isn’t reported to the police, which is a particularly problem in cases of domestic violence and sexual offences. They’re also only as good as the police’s own recording practices, which haven’t been consistent over time. Another measure is the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on surveys of very large representative samples of the population. This shows that the total number of crime incidents fell by 33% from 2009/10 to 2018/19. This data also has its problems—for example it can’t pick up crimes where there isn’t an obvious individual victim, or no victim to recall the event as is the case with murder—but it is a much more reliable measure than police recorded crime. “Local gov funding - 50%” The National Audit Office (NAO) found that government funding for councils in England fell by 49% between 2010/11 and 2017/18 in real terms. By 2019/20, it forecast the reduction to be 56%. Grants from the government aren’t the only funding sources available to councils though. The two other main sources are revenue from business rates and council tax. The amount of funding from those two has increased in recent years, meaning that what councils have to spend (known as core spending power) has fallen by less than 50% overall. We’ve written more about how this is calculated here. The NAO found that councils’ core spending power in England fell by 29% in real terms between 2010/11 and 2017/18. “Public sector pay - 15%” The 15% figure is a significant overstatement. Between May 2010 and July 2019 in Great Britain, average weekly earnings in the public sector (excluding financial services) decreased by 1-2% in real terms. The exact decrease depends on whether you use the CPI or CPIH measure of inflation, which are both valid measures.","
 
Government funding for local authorities in England fell by 49% between 2010/11 and 2017/18 in real terms, under coalition and Conservative governments. Councils have other revenue sources, and total “spending power” fell 29% in real terms in the same period.

If you look at relative poverty, before housing costs, then the increase in child poverty between 2010/11 (rather than 2009/10) and 2017/18 is 30%. That’s the biggest increase we can see in the data in relation to this claim. We did find a May 2018 article from the Independent stating: “Number of children growing up in poverty… up almost 50 per cent since 2010.” This is inaccurate as the research it is reporting on refers to children in working households growing up in poverty—not all children in poverty. “Food-bank use + 1,000%” In 2018/19, the Trussell Trust—a UK-wide network of food banks—gave out almost 1.6 million three-day emergency food supplies to people in crisis. In 2009/10 it gave out almost 41,000 three-day packages, and in 2010/11 it gave out 61,000 supplies. Looking at either year, the increase is well over 1,000% to 2018/19. This is the number of individual three-day packages given out, not the number of people using Trussell Trust food banks altogether. It’s difficult to know exactly how much this reflects increased need for emergency food supplies, and we’ve looked at this debate in more detail before. It’s also important to note that the Trussell Trust is not the only food bank network in the UK, so this isn’t a complete picture of food bank use.  “Homelessness + 170%” This most likely refers to the number of people who are sleeping rough in England (which isn’t the same as overall homelessness). Rough sleeping increased by 165% from 2010 to 2018 (we don’t have data for earlier than that). However, we shouldn’t treat these statistics as definitive. The figures are estimated by councils in autumn each year, and largely involve counting the number of people sleeping rough on the streets on a single night. These estimates are known to undercount total rough sleeping and separate estimates for London, which are taken over the course of the year, show a higher number of rough sleepers than the government data. Additionally, rough sleepers are a minority of all people who are officially defined as homeless in the UK. In many cases “homeless” refers to households that are threatened with the loss of, or unable to continue with, their current accommodation. Around 57,000 households in England were defined as homeless and owed a legal duty to be rehoused in 2017/18—an increase of 41% compared to 2009/10. “NHS waiting list + 70%” In May 2019 there were almost 4.4 million referrals for treatment on the NHS in England, where the treatment had not yet begun. These “incomplete” treatments are often referred to as the “waiting list”, and it saw an increase of 70% compared to May 2010. In the most recent data (comparing July 2010 to July 2019) the increase is 65%.  “Police numbers - 20%” There were around 202,000 members of the police workforce in England and Wales in March 2019. That’s a decrease of 17% compared to March 2010. Looking solely at police officers, the number fell by 14% over the same period—to just over 123,000 in March 2019. This excludes some officers and staff like the British Transport Police, special constables, and those on secondments to central services. “Crime + 30%” Crime is very difficult to measure accurately, but the weight of evidence suggests that overall crime has fallen since 2010—and certainly not risen by 30%. One measure—the total amount of crime recorded by the police in England and Wales—shows a 37% increase in crime between March 2010 and March 2019. But this is not a reliable way of measuring change over time. The figures can’t pick up crime that isn’t reported to the police, which is a particularly problem in cases of domestic violence and sexual offences. They’re also only as good as the police’s own recording practices, which haven’t been consistent over time. Another measure is the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on surveys of very large representative samples of the population. This shows that the total number of crime incidents fell by 33% from 2009/10 to 2018/19. This data also has its problems—for example it can’t pick up crimes where there isn’t an obvious individual victim, or no victim to recall the event as is the case with murder—but it is a much more reliable measure than police recorded crime. “Local gov funding - 50%” The National Audit Office (NAO) found that government funding for councils in England fell by 49% between 2010/11 and 2017/18 in real terms. By 2019/20, it forecast the reduction to be 56%. Grants from the government aren’t the only funding sources available to councils though. The two other main sources are revenue from business rates and council tax. The amount of funding from those two has increased in recent years, meaning that what councils have to spend (known as core spending power) has fallen by less than 50% overall. We’ve written more about how this is calculated here. The NAO found that councils’ core spending power in England fell by 29% in real terms between 2010/11 and 2017/18. “Public sector pay - 15%” The 15% figure is a significant overstatement. Between May 2010 and July 2019 in Great Britain, average weekly earnings in the public sector (excluding financial services) decreased by 1-2% in real terms. The exact decrease depends on whether you use the CPI or CPIH measure of inflation, which are both valid measures.","
 
The estimated number of rough sleepers is up 165% in England between 2010 and 2018, under coalition and Conservative governments. But this data is known to undercount rough sleeping so those figures are not definitive. Also many people who aren’t sleeping rough are also defined as homeless. The number of households that were homeless for any reason increased by 41% between 2009/10 and 2017/18 in England.

After nine years of a Conservative government, public sector pay is down 15%.
","“Everyone needs reminding that after 9 years of a Tory Government: “Child poverty + 50% “Food-bank use + 1,000% “Homelessness + 170% “NHS waiting list + 70% “Police numbers - 20% “Crime + 30% “Local gov funding - 50% “Public sector pay - 15%” Freddie Bailey (Labour councillor), 5 October 2019 A viral tweet by a Labour councillor has been shared over 13,000 times. It makes a number of claims about what has happened after “9 years of a Tory Government”. Of the eight claims, three are flatly wrong—the ones about child poverty, crime, and public sector pay. The other five claims are accurate, although some could benefit from additional context. This article takes a look at each of the claims in turn, looking at the records of the coalition government from 2010-2015 and the Conservatives alone since then. Some of the figures seem to refer to the whole of the UK, while others focus on England and Wales, we’ve indicated where that is the case. “Child poverty + 50%” There are a number of ways to measure child poverty, but none of them show an increase of close to 50% since 2010. The Social Metrics Commission, an independent group of experts on poverty, estimates that the number of UK children in poverty in 2017/18 is down by 2%, compared to 2009/10. The percentage of children in poverty is also down by two percentage points. In addition, two standard measures of poverty used by government are the number of children living in a household in relative or absolute poverty (you can read more about how those measures are calculated here). The number of children living in relative poverty in the UK in 2017/18 is up 5%, compared to 2009/10 (the last year before the Coalition government came into office). The percentage of children in relative poverty is the same now as it was in 2009/10. The number of children living in absolute poverty is down 3%, and the percentage of children is down two percentage points. These estimates all account for the housing costs of a household. But separate figures measure poverty before you factor that in.

This data also has its problems—for example it can’t pick up crimes where there isn’t an obvious individual victim, or no victim to recall the event as is the case with murder—but it is a much more reliable measure than police recorded crime. “Local gov funding - 50%” The National Audit Office (NAO) found that government funding for councils in England fell by 49% between 2010/11 and 2017/18 in real terms. By 2019/20, it forecast the reduction to be 56%. Grants from the government aren’t the only funding sources available to councils though. The two other main sources are revenue from business rates and council tax. The amount of funding from those two has increased in recent years, meaning that what councils have to spend (known as core spending power) has fallen by less than 50% overall. We’ve written more about how this is calculated here. The NAO found that councils’ core spending power in England fell by 29% in real terms between 2010/11 and 2017/18. “Public sector pay - 15%” The 15% figure is a significant overstatement. Between May 2010 and July 2019 in Great Britain, average weekly earnings in the public sector (excluding financial services) decreased by 1-2% in real terms. The exact decrease depends on whether you use the CPI or CPIH measure of inflation, which are both valid measures.","
 
In May 2019 there were 4.4 million referrals for treatment on the NHS in England, where the treatment had not yet begun. That’s an increase of 70% compared to May 2010. The period covers coalition and Conservative governments.

After nine years of a Conservative government, police numbers are down 20%.
","“Everyone needs reminding that after 9 years of a Tory Government: “Child poverty + 50% “Food-bank use + 1,000% “Homelessness + 170% “NHS waiting list + 70% “Police numbers - 20% “Crime + 30% “Local gov funding - 50% “Public sector pay - 15%” Freddie Bailey (Labour councillor), 5 October 2019 A viral tweet by a Labour councillor has been shared over 13,000 times. It makes a number of claims about what has happened after “9 years of a Tory Government”. Of the eight claims, three are flatly wrong—the ones about child poverty, crime, and public sector pay. The other five claims are accurate, although some could benefit from additional context. This article takes a look at each of the claims in turn, looking at the records of the coalition government from 2010-2015 and the Conservatives alone since then. Some of the figures seem to refer to the whole of the UK, while others focus on England and Wales, we’ve indicated where that is the case. “Child poverty + 50%” There are a number of ways to measure child poverty, but none of them show an increase of close to 50% since 2010. The Social Metrics Commission, an independent group of experts on poverty, estimates that the number of UK children in poverty in 2017/18 is down by 2%, compared to 2009/10. The percentage of children in poverty is also down by two percentage points. In addition, two standard measures of poverty used by government are the number of children living in a household in relative or absolute poverty (you can read more about how those measures are calculated here). The number of children living in relative poverty in the UK in 2017/18 is up 5%, compared to 2009/10 (the last year before the Coalition government came into office). The percentage of children in relative poverty is the same now as it was in 2009/10. The number of children living in absolute poverty is down 3%, and the percentage of children is down two percentage points. These estimates all account for the housing costs of a household. But separate figures measure poverty before you factor that in. If you look at relative poverty, before housing costs, then the increase in child poverty between 2010/11 (rather than 2009/10) and 2017/18 is 30%. That’s the biggest increase we can see in the data in relation to this claim. We did find a May 2018 article from the Independent stating: “Number of children growing up in poverty… up almost 50 per cent since 2010.” This is inaccurate as the research it is reporting on refers to children in working households growing up in poverty—not all children in poverty. “Food-bank use + 1,000%” In 2018/19, the Trussell Trust—a UK-wide network of food banks—gave out almost 1.6 million three-day emergency food supplies to people in crisis. In 2009/10 it gave out almost 41,000 three-day packages, and in 2010/11 it gave out 61,000 supplies. Looking at either year, the increase is well over 1,000% to 2018/19. This is the number of individual three-day packages given out, not the number of people using Trussell Trust food banks altogether. It’s difficult to know exactly how much this reflects increased need for emergency food supplies, and we’ve looked at this debate in more detail before. It’s also important to note that the Trussell Trust is not the only food bank network in the UK, so this isn’t a complete picture of food bank use.  “Homelessness + 170%” This most likely refers to the number of people who are sleeping rough in England (which isn’t the same as overall homelessness). Rough sleeping increased by 165% from 2010 to 2018 (we don’t have data for earlier than that). However, we shouldn’t treat these statistics as definitive. The figures are estimated by councils in autumn each year, and largely involve counting the number of people sleeping rough on the streets on a single night. These estimates are known to undercount total rough sleeping and separate estimates for London, which are taken over the course of the year, show a higher number of rough sleepers than the government data. Additionally, rough sleepers are a minority of all people who are officially defined as homeless in the UK. In many cases “homeless” refers to households that are threatened with the loss of, or unable to continue with, their current accommodation. Around 57,000 households in England were defined as homeless and owed a legal duty to be rehoused in 2017/18—an increase of 41% compared to 2009/10. “NHS waiting list + 70%” In May 2019 there were almost 4.4 million referrals for treatment on the NHS in England, where the treatment had not yet begun. These “incomplete” treatments are often referred to as the “waiting list”, and it saw an increase of 70% compared to May 2010. In the most recent data (comparing July 2010 to July 2019) the increase is 65%.  “Police numbers - 20%” There were around 202,000 members of the police workforce in England and Wales in March 2019. That’s a decrease of 17% compared to March 2010. Looking solely at police officers, the number fell by 14% over the same period—to just over 123,000 in March 2019. This excludes some officers and staff like the British Transport Police, special constables, and those on secondments to central services. “Crime + 30%” Crime is very difficult to measure accurately, but the weight of evidence suggests that overall crime has fallen since 2010—and certainly not risen by 30%. One measure—the total amount of crime recorded by the police in England and Wales—shows a 37% increase in crime between March 2010 and March 2019. But this is not a reliable way of measuring change over time. The figures can’t pick up crime that isn’t reported to the police, which is a particularly problem in cases of domestic violence and sexual offences. They’re also only as good as the police’s own recording practices, which haven’t been consistent over time. Another measure is the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on surveys of very large representative samples of the population. This shows that the total number of crime incidents fell by 33% from 2009/10 to 2018/19. This data also has its problems—for example it can’t pick up crimes where there isn’t an obvious individual victim, or no victim to recall the event as is the case with murder—but it is a much more reliable measure than police recorded crime. “Local gov funding - 50%” The National Audit Office (NAO) found that government funding for councils in England fell by 49% between 2010/11 and 2017/18 in real terms.

After nine years of a Conservative government, food bank use is up 1,000%.
","“Everyone needs reminding that after 9 years of a Tory Government: “Child poverty + 50% “Food-bank use + 1,000% “Homelessness + 170% “NHS waiting list + 70% “Police numbers - 20% “Crime + 30% “Local gov funding - 50% “Public sector pay - 15%” Freddie Bailey (Labour councillor), 5 October 2019 A viral tweet by a Labour councillor has been shared over 13,000 times. It makes a number of claims about what has happened after “9 years of a Tory Government”. Of the eight claims, three are flatly wrong—the ones about child poverty, crime, and public sector pay. The other five claims are accurate, although some could benefit from additional context. This article takes a look at each of the claims in turn, looking at the records of the coalition government from 2010-2015 and the Conservatives alone since then. Some of the figures seem to refer to the whole of the UK, while others focus on England and Wales, we’ve indicated where that is the case. “Child poverty + 50%” There are a number of ways to measure child poverty, but none of them show an increase of close to 50% since 2010. The Social Metrics Commission, an independent group of experts on poverty, estimates that the number of UK children in poverty in 2017/18 is down by 2%, compared to 2009/10. The percentage of children in poverty is also down by two percentage points. In addition, two standard measures of poverty used by government are the number of children living in a household in relative or absolute poverty (you can read more about how those measures are calculated here). The number of children living in relative poverty in the UK in 2017/18 is up 5%, compared to 2009/10 (the last year before the Coalition government came into office). The percentage of children in relative poverty is the same now as it was in 2009/10. The number of children living in absolute poverty is down 3%, and the percentage of children is down two percentage points. These estimates all account for the housing costs of a household. But separate figures measure poverty before you factor that in. If you look at relative poverty, before housing costs, then the increase in child poverty between 2010/11 (rather than 2009/10) and 2017/18 is 30%. That’s the biggest increase we can see in the data in relation to this claim. We did find a May 2018 article from the Independent stating: “Number of children growing up in poverty… up almost 50 per cent since 2010.” This is inaccurate as the research it is reporting on refers to children in working households growing up in poverty—not all children in poverty. “Food-bank use + 1,000%” In 2018/19, the Trussell Trust—a UK-wide network of food banks—gave out almost 1.6 million three-day emergency food supplies to people in crisis. In 2009/10 it gave out almost 41,000 three-day packages, and in 2010/11 it gave out 61,000 supplies. Looking at either year, the increase is well over 1,000% to 2018/19. This is the number of individual three-day packages given out, not the number of people using Trussell Trust food banks altogether. It’s difficult to know exactly how much this reflects increased need for emergency food supplies, and we’ve looked at this debate in more detail before. It’s also important to note that the Trussell Trust is not the only food bank network in the UK, so this isn’t a complete picture of food bank use.  “Homelessness + 170%” This most likely refers to the number of people who are sleeping rough in England (which isn’t the same as overall homelessness). Rough sleeping increased by 165% from 2010 to 2018 (we don’t have data for earlier than that). However, we shouldn’t treat these statistics as definitive. The figures are estimated by councils in autumn each year, and largely involve counting the number of people sleeping rough on the streets on a single night. These estimates are known to undercount total rough sleeping and separate estimates for London, which are taken over the course of the year, show a higher number of rough sleepers than the government data. Additionally, rough sleepers are a minority of all people who are officially defined as homeless in the UK. In many cases “homeless” refers to households that are threatened with the loss of, or unable to continue with, their current accommodation. Around 57,000 households in England were defined as homeless and owed a legal duty to be rehoused in 2017/18—an increase of 41% compared to 2009/10. “NHS waiting list + 70%” In May 2019 there were almost 4.4 million referrals for treatment on the NHS in England, where the treatment had not yet begun. These “incomplete” treatments are often referred to as the “waiting list”, and it saw an increase of 70% compared to May 2010. In the most recent data (comparing July 2010 to July 2019) the increase is 65%.  “Police numbers - 20%” There were around 202,000 members of the police workforce in England and Wales in March 2019. That’s a decrease of 17% compared to March 2010. Looking solely at police officers, the number fell by 14% over the same period—to just over 123,000 in March 2019. This excludes some officers and staff like the British Transport Police, special constables, and those on secondments to central services. “Crime + 30%” Crime is very difficult to measure accurately, but the weight of evidence suggests that overall crime has fallen since 2010—and certainly not risen by 30%. One measure—the total amount of crime recorded by the police in England and Wales—shows a 37% increase in crime between March 2010 and March 2019. But this is not a reliable way of measuring change over time. The figures can’t pick up crime that isn’t reported to the police, which is a particularly problem in cases of domestic violence and sexual offences. They’re also only as good as the police’s own recording practices, which haven’t been consistent over time. Another measure is the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on surveys of very large representative samples of the population. This shows that the total number of crime incidents fell by 33% from 2009/10 to 2018/19. This data also has its problems—for example it can’t pick up crimes where there isn’t an obvious individual victim, or no victim to recall the event as is the case with murder—but it is a much more reliable measure than police recorded crime. “Local gov funding - 50%” The National Audit Office (NAO) found that government funding for councils in England fell by 49% between 2010/11 and 2017/18 in real terms. By 2019/20, it forecast the reduction to be 56%. Grants from the government aren’t the only funding sources available to councils though. The two other main sources are revenue from business rates and council tax. The amount of funding from those two has increased in recent years, meaning that what councils have to spend (known as core spending power) has fallen by less than 50% overall. We’ve written more about how this is calculated here. The NAO found that councils’ core spending power in England fell by 29% in real terms between 2010/11 and 2017/18. “Public sector pay - 15%” The 15% figure is a significant overstatement. Between May 2010 and July 2019 in Great Britain, average weekly earnings in the public sector (excluding financial services) decreased by 1-2% in real terms. The exact decrease depends on whether you use the CPI or CPIH measure of inflation, which are both valid measures.","
 
The increase is over 1000%, looking at the number of three-day food packages handed out by the Trussell Trust, which runs a network of food banks in the UK. This does not cover all food banks in the UK though. The period covers coalition and Conservative governments.

Incorrect. There’s no perfect measure of crime, but best estimates suggest it has fallen in England and Wales between 2009/10 and 2018/19, under coalition and Conservative governments.

Labour’s universal basic income policy would cost £504 billion.
","""Labour is planning an eye-watering benefits splurge that would cost taxpayers around £520 billion a year, analysis has found..."" Daily Express, 23 September 2019 Earlier this week the Daily Express’ front page led with an exclusive on the cost of the Labour party’s welfare spending proposals. The article cites unpublished analysis done by the Conservative party and claims that the proposals would take the UK welfare bill up to £520 billion a year. (The value of what is currently spent on welfare depends on what you count in that category, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies says spending on welfare is currently around £224 billion a year—£98 billion for non-pensioners and £126 billion for pensioners). The Express’ claim  is misleading, because most of the supposed spending is based on the assumption that Labour introduces a basic income at a specific level. Labour have pledged to trial a basic income in certain areas, but not specified the level at which this will be or their intention to roll the scheme out nationally . Even if we ignore this factor, neither the Express nor the Conservatives have published any further details on this analysis, so we can’t say how accurate their sums are overall. Analysis like this should be published in full so that anyone can check where it’s from and how it’s calculated. We can take a look at some of the elements of spending the report mentions though.  Most of the supposed spending (£504 billion of the total £520 billion) comes from the cost of delivering a universal basic income. This, as the name suggests, is the idea to give every citizen, regardless of their wealth or income, a regular basic income from the state. However, there is no indication that Labour Party policy is to immediately introduce a basic income for all. Labour suggested it plans to trial basic income if it gets into government. We don’t know how many people would be involved, or the level of basic income they would receive. If we look beyond that issue, we can ask how accurate the Express’ claim is that rolling out a universal basic income across the country would cost £504 billion. The problem is that we don’t know at what level a  basic income might be set, so it’s impossible to estimate its total cost. We’ve asked Labour, the Conservatives and the Express for more information about how the figures in the article were calculated. The cost of delivering a universal basic income could vary considerably   depending on who is eligible and what level it is set at (and linked to this, whether it will constitute a total replacement for other types of benefits or supplement them). If you ignore any cost of actually administering the scheme, £504 billion is the equivalent of providing a universal basic income of around £9,600 a year to each adult aged 18 or over in the UK.     That’s not an unreasonable estimate of the costs of a basic income. For example, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) says   a universal basic income should provide a basic standard of living for everyone, and so makes estimates based on the poverty threshold in each country. In the UK the ILO says that threshold is £8,800 per year for an adult, so not that far below the £9,600. But a universal basic income could also be far less generous and so far less costly.  On top of the £504 billion the Express adds the cost of various policies proposed by Labour to get to a total of £520 billion. For example, it says the cost of scrapping plans to raise the retirement age to 67 (as pledged in Labour’s 2017 manifesto) would cost £9.9 billion according to “financial experts”. We’ve not been able to find the figure and the Express haven’t told us their source. But it wouldn’t necessarily be the case that the cost of this would be in addition to any universal basic income that was introduced. A basic income could possibly remove the need to have the existing benefits system, including state pensions. Correction 26 February 2020  We initially said that Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell would study a proposal for a basic income of £48 per week. In fact Mr McDonnell said he would study a report that included mention of a £48 per week figure but did not endorse it.","
 
This is based on the assumption that the Labour Party introduces universal basic income for all adults at a certain level. It has so far only said it will trial such a scheme if it gets into government and not released much detail on how such a scheme would work.

The DWP employs 3,300 staff to investigate welfare fraud.
","A post shared on Facebook over 350 times makes a number of claims about welfare and tax fraud. The figures used are incorrect and out of date, and it’s not straightforward to compare the DWP and HMRC. These claims are similar to some others we’ve covered in the past. In 2018/19 the DWP estimated £2.3 billion  was lost from fraudulent overpayments of benefits. The figure has increased every year since 2013/14 (the last time it was estimated at £1.2 billion). That’s about 1.2% of all benefit spending, and just over half of all the money overpaid that year (£4.1 billion). However, some of the money lost through overpayments is reclaimed. £1.1 billion of the total £4.1 billion lost was reclaimed in 2018/19. Money lost to fraud can only ever be estimated. The DWP investigates a sample of benefit claims to identify overpayments and underpayments, and decides whether to count them as fraud, claimant error or official error. In 2017/18 HMRC estimated the ‘tax gap’, money that should in theory have been collected in taxes but wasn’t, at around £35 billion , or 5.6% of the total estimated tax. Not all of that is due to fraud or deliberate evasion. £12 billion is attributed to tax evasion, avoidance and organised crime. The rest is due to “failure to take reasonable care” by the taxpayer, errors, the “hidden economy” and differences in legal interpretations. 40% of this ‘tax gap’ is due to small businesses, and the most common taxes are income tax, national insurance contributions, capital gains tax, and VAT. Again, these are estimates of the loss.  HMRC also estimated that its compliance division collected £34 billion in 2017/18 that would have been lost “through fraud, tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance”. As of July 2018 the DWP employed 1,405 full-time equivalent specialists to investigate benefit fraud. Data from 2017 suggests another 2,000 or so full-time equivalent staff may be doing related work. In February 2018 HMRC employed around 26,000 people “tackling all forms of non-compliance in the tax system”. The 300 figure may be a repeat of a claim we checked in 2016. Back then around 300 people worked in one team called the “Affluent Unit”; around 500 people worked in this team in 2017. The Affluent Unit investigated people with an annual income of at least £150,000 a year, or wealth of £1 million or more. A similarly-sized team investigated people with assets worth over £10m. Using more recent numbers makes tax evasion and avoidance about 15 times greater than benefit fraud, not 25. That’s not the real problem with these claims though. The main issue is that we can’t properly compare different teams working in different departments of government like this. Comparing staff numbers doesn’t give us a full picture of what departments are doing, and we don’t have a full picture of staff numbers to begin with. The DWP and HMRC also use different methods to estimate fraud and error (and it’s complicated enough as it is).     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.

£30 billion is lost to tax fraud.
","A post shared on Facebook over 350 times makes a number of claims about welfare and tax fraud. The figures used are incorrect and out of date, and it’s not straightforward to compare the DWP and HMRC. These claims are similar to some others we’ve covered in the past. In 2018/19 the DWP estimated £2.3 billion  was lost from fraudulent overpayments of benefits. The figure has increased every year since 2013/14 (the last time it was estimated at £1.2 billion). That’s about 1.2% of all benefit spending, and just over half of all the money overpaid that year (£4.1 billion). However, some of the money lost through overpayments is reclaimed. £1.1 billion of the total £4.1 billion lost was reclaimed in 2018/19. Money lost to fraud can only ever be estimated. The DWP investigates a sample of benefit claims to identify overpayments and underpayments, and decides whether to count them as fraud, claimant error or official error. In 2017/18 HMRC estimated the ‘tax gap’, money that should in theory have been collected in taxes but wasn’t, at around £35 billion , or 5.6% of the total estimated tax. Not all of that is due to fraud or deliberate evasion. £12 billion is attributed to tax evasion, avoidance and organised crime. The rest is due to “failure to take reasonable care” by the taxpayer, errors, the “hidden economy” and differences in legal interpretations. 40% of this ‘tax gap’ is due to small businesses, and the most common taxes are income tax, national insurance contributions, capital gains tax, and VAT. Again, these are estimates of the loss.  HMRC also estimated that its compliance division collected £34 billion in 2017/18 that would have been lost “through fraud, tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance”. As of July 2018 the DWP employed 1,405 full-time equivalent specialists to investigate benefit fraud. Data from 2017 suggests another 2,000 or so full-time equivalent staff may be doing related work. In February 2018 HMRC employed around 26,000 people “tackling all forms of non-compliance in the tax system”. The 300 figure may be a repeat of a claim we checked in 2016. Back then around 300 people worked in one team called the “Affluent Unit”; around 500 people worked in this team in 2017. The Affluent Unit investigated people with an annual income of at least £150,000 a year, or wealth of £1 million or more. A similarly-sized team investigated people with assets worth over £10m. Using more recent numbers makes tax evasion and avoidance about 15 times greater than benefit fraud, not 25. That’s not the real problem with these claims though. The main issue is that we can’t properly compare different teams working in different departments of government like this. Comparing staff numbers doesn’t give us a full picture of what departments are doing, and we don’t have a full picture of staff numbers to begin with. The DWP and HMRC also use different methods to estimate fraud and error (and it’s complicated enough as it is).     This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.    For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as mixture        as most of the figures are wrong or out-of-date.    ","

","  “A report has revealed HMRC employ just 522 staff to tackle tens of billions of tax evasion by the super-rich but the DWP employ 4,045 to tackle benefit fraud.” @Rachael_Swindon, 26 June 2018 “HMRC employ just 522 staff to tackle tax evasion by the super-rich but the DWP employ 4,045 to tackle benefit fraud.” Scottish National Party The SNP and a widely shared post on Twitter compare the number of staff working at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) tackling tax evasion and the number working at the Department of Work and Pensions on benefit fraud. We’ve looked at similar claims in the past. As of March 2017, HMRC employed around 500 staff to work with “high net worth” individuals, with assets over £10m, on their tax affairs. It employed another 500 or so staff to investigate the tax affairs “affluent” taxpayers with an income over £150,000 a year, or assets over £1 million. In 2016, The National Audit Office (NAO) estimated that there are around 550,000 affluent and super-rich taxpayers, and within that group they estimated there to be around £2 billion in lost tax revenue, primarily due to tax avoidance and the disputes over how tax law is interpreted. The NAO told us it referred to the amount of tax at risk from wealthy taxpayers at that time, and is not based on a single tax year. Tax avoidance is the exploitation of tax rules to gain an advantage which wasn’t intended by Parliament. “It involves operating within the letter – but not the spirit – of the law”, according to the National Audit Office. As of October 2017, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) employed around 4,000 staff to deal with benefit fraud, with around 1,900 of these directly involved in investigations. An estimated £2 billion in benefits were fraudulently claimed in 2017/18. These two sets of staff do different jobs in different government departments, so comparing the number of staff in each team won’t give us the full picture of their roles. HMRC employed roughly 522 full-time equivalent staff in its “high-net worth unit” as of 31 March 2017. That’s the number of full-time staff there would be if everyone’s hours were added together. The high net worth unit deals with individuals defined as having assets (minus any debts) of over £10 million—though until 2016/17 it was those with a net worth of £20 million. HMRC assigns each high net worth individual a “customer relationship manager” to deal with their tax affairs. These managers are meant to develop an understanding of the taxpayer’s affairs and behaviours and “resolve issues before they submit their tax return”. Not all of the 522 staff will be managers, they also have a team of staff that works with them—in 2015/16 there were 40 managers out of around 400 staff (equating to about 160 high-net worth taxpayers for every manager). HMRC employs about 518 more staff to investigate “affluent” taxpayers—that’s people with an annual income of at least £150,000 a year, or wealth of £1 million or more. The affluent unit is tasked with investigating where wealthy individuals are avoiding or evading taxes. In 2016, the National Audit Office reported that there were around 550,000 affluent or high-net worth taxpayers, and that they could account for around £2 billion in lost tax revenue, primarily due to tax avoidance and the disputes over how tax law is interpreted. Tax avoidance is the exploitation of tax rules to gain an advantage which wasn’t intended by Parliament, but which is legal. Tax evasion is an illegal activity where people conceal or misrepresent information in order to reduce the tax they pay. HMRC estimates that £1.7 billion in tax revenue was lost through avoidance in 2016/17, £5.3 billion was lost through differences in legal interpretation, and another £5.3 billion was through evasion. As of October 2017, DWP employs around 4,045 full-time equivalent staff to deal with benefit fraud. Of these, 1,928 full-time equivalent staff are directly involved in investigations. An estimated £2 billion in benefits were fraudulently claimed in 2017/18, according to the government. That’s the equivalent of 1.2% of total benefit expenditure. You can read more about types of benefit fraud here. We’ve asked DWP for more information about the cases which their benefit fraud team deals with. When we last looked into a similar claim two years ago, HMRC told us its dedicated units were important parts of its work in stopping tax evasion and avoidance, but far from the sum total. Update 10 July 2018  We updated the piece with additional information we received from the NAO, on what time period the £2 billion in lost tax revenue from affluent and high-net worth taxpayers related to. ","It employed around 500 staff in March 2017 to work with taxpayers with assets over £10m, and another 500 staff to investigate the tax affairs of taxpayers with assets over £1 million, or an income over £150,000 a year. In 2016, they were estimated to account for around £2bn in lost tax revenue.

3,250 people investigate benefit fraud compared to 300 who investigate tax evasion.
","“Some 3,250 Department for Work and Pensions staff have been specifically investigating benefit fraud, while only 300 HMRC staff have been systematically investigating tax evasion…  “Why have this Government had 10 times more staff dealing often with the poorest in society abusing benefits than with the super-rich evading their taxes?” Angus Robertson MP, 13 April 2016 It’s wrong to say that only 300 HMRC staff investigate tax evasion. This is just one team within HMRC looking at both tax evasion and avoidance among wealthy individuals. Even then, there are another 400 staff in another team who focus on even wealthier people. HMRC employs over 26,000 staff working in enforcement and compliance. Mr Robertson has a point if he means to compare staffing on benefit fraud and error with avoidance and evasion among just the very rich. The two teams we’ve mentioned add up to about 700 staff focused on these wealthy individuals. Meanwhile just under 3,800 staff work at the DWP’s Fraud and Error Service. Investigating fraud and error at the DWP The DWP confirmed to us that currently 3,765 staff do work relating to benefit fraud and error at what’s called the Fraud and Error Service. Mr Robertson’s figure is an older version of this. Benefit fraud is illegal—it happens when people knowingly claim too much. Error, on the other hand, involves accidents on the part of claimants or officials. Benefit fraud was estimated to cost £1.3 billion in 2014/15. Adding in error there was a total of £3 billion overpaid in benefits. Welcome to the Affluent Unit Tax evasion is illegal activity where people conceal or misrepresent information in order to reduce the tax they pay. Avoidance is the exploitation of tax rules to gain an advantage which wasn’t intended by Parliament, but which is legal. Evasion was estimated to cost £4.4 billion in 2013/14, and adding in tax avoidance puts the total at just over £7 billion. Other activities also add to the bill for lost tax. The Affluent Unit works within HMRC, and is tasked with investigating where wealthy individuals are avoiding or evading taxes. It was set up in 2011, and covers people with incomes of over £150,000, or wealth of between £1 million and £20 million. The unit has about 300 staff, although it’s difficult to get a precise, up-to-date figure. It reportedly employed 327 to look at evasion and avoidance in 2014/15. This doesn’t include the wealthiest individuals There’s also another unit which covers people with wealth over £20 million called the High Net Worth Unit. It has around 400 staff. So the parts of HMRC covering these activities among the wealthiest individuals could be said to have around 700 staff. And it doesn’t include everybody else HMRC told us it had over 26,000 people working across the range of its enforcement and compliance business, which is focused on stopping both tax evasion and avoidance. It said its dedicated units were important parts of that, but far from the sum total. The SNP told us it acknowledged the HMRC figure was just for the very rich and not a like-for-like comparison with the DWP staff. It said it wanted to highlight the lack of transparency with the figures, given that it’s not possible to get specific breakdowns of what HMRC staff are doing, beyond looking at individual teams like the Affluent Unit. That may well be the case, but Mr Robertson’s claim still wasn’t justified by the available figures.   An earlier version of this factcheck appeared in our roundup from Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday.","
 
This isn’t comparing like-with-like and the DWP figure is out of date. The staff mentioned work on all benefit fraud and error and tax evasion and avoidance, not just the illegal activities.

84,fullfact,"There are 10 times more staff dealing with benefits abuse than with tax evasion by the super-rich.
","“Some 3,250 Department for Work and Pensions staff have been specifically investigating benefit fraud, while only 300 HMRC staff have been systematically investigating tax evasion…  “Why have this Government had 10 times more staff dealing often with the poorest in society abusing benefits than with the super-rich evading their taxes?” Angus Robertson MP, 13 April 2016 It’s wrong to say that only 300 HMRC staff investigate tax evasion. This is just one team within HMRC looking at both tax evasion and avoidance among wealthy individuals. Even then, there are another 400 staff in another team who focus on even wealthier people. HMRC employs over 26,000 staff working in enforcement and compliance. Mr Robertson has a point if he means to compare staffing on benefit fraud and error with avoidance and evasion among just the very rich. The two teams we’ve mentioned add up to about 700 staff focused on these wealthy individuals. Meanwhile just under 3,800 staff work at the DWP’s Fraud and Error Service. Investigating fraud and error at the DWP The DWP confirmed to us that currently 3,765 staff do work relating to benefit fraud and error at what’s called the Fraud and Error Service. Mr Robertson’s figure is an older version of this. Benefit fraud is illegal—it happens when people knowingly claim too much. Error, on the other hand, involves accidents on the part of claimants or officials. Benefit fraud was estimated to cost £1.3 billion in 2014/15. Adding in error there was a total of £3 billion overpaid in benefits. Welcome to the Affluent Unit Tax evasion is illegal activity where people conceal or misrepresent information in order to reduce the tax they pay. Avoidance is the exploitation of tax rules to gain an advantage which wasn’t intended by Parliament, but which is legal. Evasion was estimated to cost £4.4 billion in 2013/14, and adding in tax avoidance puts the total at just over £7 billion. Other activities also add to the bill for lost tax. The Affluent Unit works within HMRC, and is tasked with investigating where wealthy individuals are avoiding or evading taxes. It was set up in 2011, and covers people with incomes of over £150,000, or wealth of between £1 million and £20 million.

85,fullfact," Independent experts have suggested that Google is paying an effective tax rate on its UK profits of around 3%.
","“Independent experts have suggested that Google is paying an effective tax rate on its UK profits of around 3%.” Jeremy Corbyn, 27 January 2016 Google and HMRC, the tax authority, have agreed that the company will pay an additional £130 million tax for the last decade. Several experts have said that this, along with the tax it has paid, represents only around 3-5% of the profits that they think Google should be taxed on. They say that Google doesn’t pay as much tax as it should because its advertising sales are counted as taking place in Ireland rather than the UK. Their calculations have in turn been criticised for “wishful thinking” and not taking account of how the tax system works. HMRC says that it hasn’t agreed with Google any less than the full amount of tax due. In reality we don’t know how much the new settlement takes account of the sales profits that people think Google should be taxed on because that data isn’t publicly available. The way Corporation Tax works Corporation Tax is based on profits made on “economic activity” in the UK. The government has emphasised this is not the same as profits made on sales in the UK. The Public Accounts Committee said in 2013 that “to avoid UK corporation tax, Google relies on the deeply unconvincing argument that its sales to UK clients take place in Ireland, despite clear evidence that the vast majority of sales activity takes place in the UK.” While Google’s advertising sales are recorded in Ireland (where there’s a lower Corporation Tax rate), Richard Murphy from the organisation Tax Research UK has argued that the real economic activity relating to advertising on UK websites is taking place in the UK. Others have dismissed this argument, saying it’s not how Google works. What has been agreed Google says the £130m figure represents “the full amount of tax that HM Revenue and Customs agrees we should pay”. It told us it will now pay tax based on revenue from UK-based advertisers. We’ve asked them how this applies to what’s been agreed for the last decade.   HMRC isn’t releasing the full details of the settlement, because it says that information is legally confidential. Google doesn’t publish its accounts by country in detail either. So that means that we don’t know to what extent this new settlement reflects the real amount of profits that commentators have said Google should be taxed on. It all comes down to how much of Google’s sales profits have been counted as profits on “economic activity” in the UK. Experts have been trying to roughly work out for themselves how much profit Google makes on its sales in the UK and so how much this new settlement takes account of that.  Both Richard Murphy, and Professor Prem Sikka from the University of Essex, have said that this tax settlement represents somewhere around 3-5% of its likely UK profits. They’ve done this by taking Google’s sales data (which it does publish by country) and applied what’s thought to be Google’s global profit rate to that data to work out a figure for its sales profits in the UK. The exact data they’ve taken differs slightly. For example, Professor Sikka has looked at Google’s sales over the last ten years, while Richard Murphy has looked at 2014. To take Professor Sikka’s calculations, he says that Google reports roughly £24 billion in sales in the UK over the period 2005-2014. Applying a rough profit margin of around 30% (which he says is the informed industry view—Mr Murphy uses a figure of 25%), that would suggest Google made around £7.2 billion in profit over the ten-year period. Professor Sikka says Google had already committed to paying around £70 million over the period (excluding data for 2014 which isn’t available). Adding that to Google’s settlement of £130 million makes the overall tax paid over the period £200 million. That represents about 2.8% of those £7.2 billion profits. But others have said attributing all of Google’s sales profits to the UK ignores the role that people working in its American base play in generating those profits. For example, the people who make up Google’s legal, finance and HR teams, and the people who build the tech and write the code that makes Google work. The Public Accounts Committee says it will be calling in HMRC and Google to explain the deal. The legalities There’s a fine line between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion. Tax avoidance refers to the legal exploitation of tax rules to gain an advantage that was never intended. It involves “operating within the letter but not the spirit of the law”.  This differs from tax evasion which is illegal. It’s where information has been deliberated omitted, concealed or misrepresented to reduce the amount of tax owed. HMRC says it can tackle some tax avoidance or aggressive tax planning under UK law. The difficulty is in determining when something is aggressive tax avoidance. Correction 29 January 2016 We said that HMRC said it hadn’t accepted any lower than the 20% Corporation Tax rate. This should have said HMRC says it has not accepted any less than the full tax due. Rates have changed over time and depend on the size of profits. Update 4 February 2016 We updated the article to include criticisms that have been made of the 3% figure by other commentators. We've also updated our conclusion to make it clearer. ","This all comes down to how people think Google’s “economic activity” in the UK should be defined. Several experts have said that the amount of tax that Google is paying over the last decade represents only around 3-5% of the profits that they think Google should be taxed on. HMRC says that Google will be paying the full tax due. Without the full details, we don’t know to what extent this agreement accounts for the concerns that people have about Google’s tax arrangements.

","“Edward Troup… the new executive chair of the tax authorities, once apparently described taxation as ‘legalised extortion’” Justin Webb, 11 April 2016 “With the greatest respect, if he said that, I cannot image a statement that’s been taken more out of context… Edward Troup has a very sound, balanced view” Graham Aaronson QC “I don’t know the context, he said it in a 1999 newspaper article and people will obviously be able to look it up” Justin Webb Edward Troup, a senior official in HM Revenue and Customs, is the man on the front page of today’s Guardian. It’s not in dispute that he once wrote that “taxation is legalised extortion”. The Today programme’s Justin Webb said this morning that “it will worry people, won’t it, that the boss of HMRC has that view of tax when he’s the person looking into the Panama Papers?” But like Graham Aaronson QC, Mr Troup himself has stressed that those four words should be seen in the context of the article it appeared in. That’s not necessarily easy to do. Newspaper articles from before the age of online editions don’t come up on Google. The full piece doesn’t seem to be available on some of the industry-standard media monitoring services that we tried, and when we eventually tracked it down it seemed to be dated 1997 rather than 1999. Helpfully, the House of Commons Library has republished a lengthy extract from the article in question, which helps to set the phrase “legalised extortion” in the context demanded. It appears in the following paragraph: “Tax law does not codify some Platonic set of tax-raising principles. Taxation is legalised extortion and is valid only to the extent of the law. Tax avoidance is not paying less tax than you ‘should’. Tax avoidance is paying less tax than Parliament would have wanted. Avoidance is where Parliament got it wrong, or didn’t foresee all possible combinations of circumstance. The problem of tax avoidance is reduced to the problem of finding an answer to the question of what parliament intended and making sure that this is complied with. I would not pretend this is a simple task. But recognising this as the issue and dealing with it equitably and constitutionally would be a significant step on the way to tackling avoidance effectively.” Mr Troup was responding to news that then-Chancellor Gordon Brown was looking into a ‘general anti-avoidance provision’. He has since said his point was that “it should not be left to the discretion of tax administrators to decide how much was due; it had to be left to the rule of law, and that is quite an important principle”. We asked the Financial Times, which originally carried Mr Troup’s article, for permission to republish it in full. They told us that the author himself has the copyright to it, so we asked HMRC if we could publish it. A HMRC spokesperson said that: “The quotation is taken out of context from an article which explored ways to reduce avoidance. Edward is one of the country’s leading tax experts, and in this article he was exploring the nature of tax avoidance and linking the problem of avoidance to issues of tax policy.” We weren't given permission to republish the piece in full, though.","He did write this, but says it should be seen in context. The words appeared in a 1997 opinion piece in the Financial Times, in which Mr Troup argued against a particular approach to preventing tax avoidance.

87,fullfact,"There was an £8 billion increase in revenues from additional rate taxpayers after the top rate of tax was reduced from 50p to 45p. 
","“Figures published this morning by HMRC contain, for the first time, the income tax data for 2013-14, which was when the 50p rate was reduced to 45p. “The data reveal that in that year there was an £8 billion increase in revenues from additional-rate taxpayers, which completely defies the predictions made by the Labour party at the time”. George Osborne, 1 March 2016 The top rate of tax was reduced from 50p per pound to 45p in April 2013. When the policy was announced, Labour criticised the government’s prediction that the overall cost would be £100 million a year, calling the assumptions behind the figure “heroic”. The total amount of tax collected from additional rate taxpayers rose from £38 billion in 2012/13, to £46 billion in 2013/14—a rise of £8 billion. But this doesn’t mean that the lower tax rate has brought in £8 billion in extra revenue, as experts such as tax barrister Jolyon Maugham and the Institute for Fiscal Studies have pointed out. At least some of the £8 billion rise can be explained by the ‘deferral’ of income by additional rate taxpayers between 2012/13 and 2013/14. They pushed some earnings back to 2013/14, when the 45p rate took effect, so that they would pay the lower rate of tax on it. The comparison ignores ‘deferral’ effects HMRC said last year that the reduction of the additional rate of tax in April 2013 had led to the postponement or ‘deferral’ of income from 2012/13 to 2013/14. It predicted this would happen when the change was being planned, forecasting that roughly £6 billion would be delayed. So, as Mr Maugham puts it, “tax receipts were artificially low in 2012-13 (because people delayed receiving income until rates fell) and were artificially high in 2013-14 (when those delayed receipts were received).” He says this delaying tactic “is likely to explain most or all” of the difference.  The government predicted that the rate reduction would cost £360m over five years Mr Maugham argues that the best way of seeing what effect the reduction in the rate has had is by comparing receipts now to what receipts would’ve been if the tax rate hadn’t been reduced. The government did some projections of this before the cut. It predicted that cutting the rate would cost £360m over five years—with a loss of £50 million 2013/14, £100 million in both 2014/15 and 2014/15 and £110 million in 2016/17. Those estimates include predictions of how people might change their behaviour as a result of the change. High earners were expected to increase the amount of taxable income they declared as a result of the rate reduction. These were and are still uncertain estimates.  Head of the IFS, Paul Johnson, told the BBC Daily Politics earlier this week that “The best estimate is that it looks like by cutting the top rate from 50p to 45p, it might have cost you a very small amount, probably… it’s not bringing in lots of additional revenue but it’s probably not costing much either.”","Revenues did increase by that much, but tax receipts were artificially low in 2012/13 and artificially high in 2013/14 due to people ‘deferring’ income from one tax year to another in order to benefit from the lower tax rate. So this can’t be described as the amount of money raised by the reduction in the rate.
